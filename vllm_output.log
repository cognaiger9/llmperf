This series of five storybooks was read to my class of 2-year-olds daily over the course of the school year. When it was time to turn to the next book, my class would wait with great anticipation. I was impressed with the sweet illustrations and stories. The narrator reads each story in a child's voice and adds sound effects. Great book for those who like fantasy stories with fantasy creatures. Recommended!

2024-09-25 03:19:41,998 - Prompt 0: The serene landscape of the countryside was
2024-09-25 03:19:41,998 - Generated text:  severely disturbed at the end of the 19th century by the abrupt rise of industry and a growing human population. Today, between 34% and 40% of the Earth’s land surface is degraded, eroded, or infertile due to modern urbanisation and industrial development.
Traditional land management practices are often unsustainable due to population growth, soil degradation, and the effects of climate change. Consequently, many countries now look towards artificial methods of increasing land productivity, such as by irrigating areas with water or fertilising soil with chemicals.
These methods often cause severe problems, with the ensuing waste being detrimental to the local environment. Artificial irrigation often causes soil salinity, which leads to the death of plant species. The overuse of chemical fertilisers is harmful to crops and aquatic ecosystems.
Agroforestry is a method of managing land that encourages the symbiotic growth of agriculture and trees, which can help reverse these problems. It combines the fields, orchards, and woodland found on conventional farms, promoting the coexistence of diverse species to increase the diversity of habitats for native plants and animals.
This alternative approach improves soil fertility, water retention, carbon storage, and natural nitrogen fixation, and can increase biological diversity and maintain the nutrient balance within the soil.
Agroforestry also reduces the risk of soil erosion and desertification, promoting more stable ecosystems that can withstand natural disasters and climate change. Additionally, the increased biodiversity provides habitat for natural pest control.
Raising the animals under trees, both human and wild, provides a natural supply of animal dung to enrich the soil and enables microorganisms to improve its fertility. The increased productivity of agroforestry is reflected in the yield of fruits, nuts, and meat, and the money earned from selling these products can help fund sustainable land management practices.
As a relatively simple method of agriculture, agroforestry is easy for local farmers to adopt and maintain. It is also relatively low cost to implement. However, its effects do not last long, with a maximum productivity of 20 years for the soil and 15 years for trees. In these instances, the farm must be restored. Agroforestry is a sustainable method of farming that can help restore ecosystems, improve biodiversity, and enhance crop yields.
Able to cultivate more farming areas, sustainably, on the same land.
Increase the aesthetic value of landscapes.
Help local communities develop positive relationships with their surroundings.
More land can be used as we increase the efficiency of the methods we use to cultivate land.
Reduce soil erosion and desertification.
Agroforestry has many benefits, but is prone to the same problems as any other method of farming. Depending on the methods used to establish it, agroforestry can be harmful to native flora and fauna. It can also be detrimental to the surrounding environment when trees are burned for fertiliser and the effects of woodland expansion spread to nearby habitats.
Agroforestry relies heavily on energy sources such as electricity, which has a negative environmental impact due to the greenhouse gases and pollution created in its production. Insufficient or poorly executed management can lead to soil salinity, waterlogging, and landslides. If the trees are irrigated, they can develop root diseases and become unstable.
As with any type of farming, the development of agroforestry can lead to a conflict of interest between stakeholders, with a given farmer’s greed for profits causing deforestation or other negative outcomes. Agroforestry is also relatively costly to implement.
The success of agroforestry is contingent on the quality of the land and the care taken by the farmer to keep it in a healthy state. Soil management, crop selection, and tree planting must be carefully considered and implemented to yield the best results. Without careful planning and adherence to sound principles, agroforestry may prove to be a poor choice for the farmer, and the land, and the region, will suffer the consequences.

2024-09-25 03:19:41,999 - Generated text:  was a magical river.
One can become God or Goddess by drinking the water of this river.
That's why the two most beautiful rivers of the world, one in Greece and the other one in India, were named it Nile and Ganges.
When at the bottom of the forest there was built the first temple dedicated to the Goddess of water, that river was called after her as well, and was named it - Ladon.
But that was in ancient times. Now we are the 21st century. In the depths of our planet there is a beautiful magical river, flowing from the mountains. It's not a Greek or an Indian river, but Russian one.
The name of this river is IREE. In ancient times IREE was known as ALDA.
This river is also called as IRENA or IRENA-A.
The power of a river is in its clean water.
As old as this river is, it has not changed at all, because it flows from the mountains and stays clean, coming straight from the springs of natural magical water, flowing out of the depths of the mountains, where there is no man.
But one can come to this river only when she needs it.
And it is amazing to see, that in order to reach it, one must take a complicated roundabout path, as through the bottom of the forest. And once at the bottom of the forest, no one will meet a soul, so wild is this place.
Everyone knows that the Goddess of the forest is IRENA. Therefore, it can be assumed that this river was once known as IRENA and now IRENA-A.
The water of this river has magical powers.
If a person drinks it, he can become a God or Goddess.
This is an ancient Russian water.
Drinking it, one gets the knowledge about all the mysteries and secrets of the world.
One gets the knowledge of past lives.
But when you drink it, you should not want to be a God or a Goddess. It does not work like that.
This water brings you out of yourself. It helps you to free your soul from itself and become God or Goddess.
Once, there was a girl, who had no idea what she was. She became a Goddess, thanks to this river. Her name was IRENA-A. But now everyone knows her as CATHERINE.
"The sadness is over
Now joy is coming.
If you know that one can become a God or Goddess
only if she drinks the water of this river,
if she becomes a God or Goddess,
to you this water gives the knowledge
of the true nature of things."
IRENA, the Goddess of the Russian forest.

To drink the magic water of this river, to feel the beauty of this river, to become one with the power of this river, to travel to the bottom of the forest, where no man goes, to feel the infinite light of the depths of this forest, where the darkness is, where there is no man, to become a God or Goddess - this is a gift from me to my sister Irina Aleksandrovna Terekhin!
For these are my feelings, my sentiments!

Widower Jake Minton has done everything to keep his four year-old son safe in the wake of his wife's sudden death. He won't let anything disturb their idyllic life in the North Carolina mountains. But when Jake inherits a large historic estate in New York City, he's forced to sell his home. There's nothing he can do but pack up his truck and move into the haunted and decrepit old mansion.
As if the dark whispers weren't enough, Jake is now torn between reuniting his family and protecting it. Emma Blake is a free spirit who lives in the moment. Her life takes her all over the world, and her travels bring her to the Empire State Building. Heather Wade is a tough, no-nonsense kind of woman who's made her home in the city. When she arrives at the Empire State Building, it's the first time she's ever taken a business trip alone. But when she gets the news about her dad, it's the last trip she's ever going to take alone.
When Heather and Emma get trapped inside the Empire State Building by a terrible snowstorm, they must join forces with Jake to survive. And as the snowdrifts get higher, so does the romantic tension. But the question remains: How much will Jake sacrifice to save his family?
Irene Hannon's best-selling series will continue to thrill readers with another nail-biting romantic suspense novel. If you're a fan of Nancy Mehl and Colleen Coble, you won't want to miss Irene Hannon's Protecting the Empire State.

Irene Hannon never disappoints
Irene Hannon has been my favorite author for many years. I was delighted to see this newest story. I liked the characters and the plot and I learned new things about New York's most famous landmark, the Empire State Building. The reader, Coleen Marlo, does a great job narrating the story. The only thing I didn't like was the story kept going in circles, like the people were having to run around over and over to the same places to find the information they were trying to get.
In between an action packed story, the author did a great job of sharing the impact of her time as an Episcopalian pastor on how she prayed for the characters. She kept this to herself, but in her own words revealed it at the end of the book.
Whether you know New York or not, this story is an entertaining romance that I thoroughly enjoyed!
Danny Travis
The ending is better than the story itself!
If you are looking for a truly inspiring ending to a novella, this is for you. Sadly, it’s not worth reading the rest of the story.
Would you listen to Protecting the Empire State again? Why?
Yes, it is definitely worth a listen again. There is so much going on in this short novel. There are at least three story lines that weave in and out of each other. This book is full of action, adventure, romance, suspense, mystery and danger. There is so much happening that the characters really need to do some reflecting when they are not running from danger.
I liked Heather Wade. She is no-nonsense, but loves her family with all her heart. She is a capable woman and is a great mix with Jake and Emma.
The love story that develops is wonderful. The reader gets a glimpse of just what it takes to protect what you love and a story of how strong love is when two people meet.
I did not listen to the narrator very much, but what I heard sounded good.
I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would listen to this book again, definitely.

2024-09-25 03:19:41,999 - Generated text:  they are not known; in search of hidden coves, of fathomless depths. While the science of oceanography provides the sailor with the most precise information about currents, tides, and wind, the chart remains his primary navigational tool. A mere sheet of paper, it contains the wealth of centuries-old knowledge that has survived through generations of sailors who have used and made corrections to it. From the coastlines and shorelines to the depths of the ocean, a sailor learns to interpret the maps in order to make his way.
The maps contained in _The Pilot_ became the handbook for the sailor, drawn and edited by a board of leading experts in oceanography. Its pages were published by the Navy's Hydrographic Office in Washington, D.C. For over fifty years, the official publication, one of the most respected and influential volumes ever published, provided the navigation foundation for those who sailed the seas. Drawn upon the hulls of warships that traversed the world, the maps gave the mariner the tools to gain mastery over the seas and oceans. By virtue of its scope and authority, it was the standard that all others measured their work against. And yet it contained many secrets, a world that remained beyond the grasp of the average sailor, a world of its own and thus of the highest interest to the military.
H. P. Lovecraft of Providence, Rhode Island, believed that he had discovered this secret world in 1918 when he was enrolled in a war-era program at the University of Rhode Island, for those who had enlisted but not yet shipped out for training. In one of his assignments, Lovecraft wrote a history of a sea creature, the Leviathan, which he had read about in a biology book in his school library. His work was well researched and detailed. In his handwritten journal, he later noted that he "admired the resemblance of Leviathan to the giant octopus and squid," as well as "the many similarities between the eye and the optic nerve in a squid and in the devil-fish of the sea." In his essay, he explained how an expedition to the deep Atlantic would prove the existence of this monster:
It is only necessary for a submarine to proceed at a depth of 1,000 feet [300 meters] in a direction perpendicular to the coast, and in its course to throw out a conical lantern . . . and, even at this extreme distance, a prolongation of the darkness of the shadow-zone will be observed upon the side of the lantern where the light was shut off. . . . The glowing shadow-zone will not be very visible, but it is likely that a diver going down with a light might make out the object and would then see for himself a strange conical cloud within a few feet of the sea bottom.
Lovecraft's essay intrigued two naval officers. Vice Admiral Charles Cooke of the U.S. Navy and Vice Admiral Aloisio Duarte de Azevedo, who was then working for the Portuguese navy, but with close connections to the U.S. Naval Intelligence Section, concluded that Lovecraft's hypothesis was worth testing. At the time, neither had any knowledge of the Leviathan, but both were particularly fascinated by the bizarre biology of the sea. Cooke was familiar with squid, and de Azevedo had just begun work on sea monsters for the navy. So with an enthusiastic letter from Cooke to de Azevedo, the plan was developed to prove the existence of the creature.
Cooke's interest in squid was fueled by his exploits as a naval officer. In the final years of the nineteenth century, the United States and Germany clashed in a series of bloody naval battles during the Spanish-American War, which allowed the American fleet to dominate world waters. Most of the time, the battles occurred at a distance, but at times the fighting was so intense that small units of American sailors who had been assigned to scout and torpedo-destroyer duties were often far ahead of the fleet and thus in harm's way. Most experienced torpedo officers carried a sharp knife, an essential tool for self-defense. Once, as a captain, Cooke used his knife to slash his attacker's throat, and he began to refer to the life-saving knife as his "squid." By the time he took on the secret Navy project, he was a longtime advisor on submarine and anti-submarine operations.

“It’s a real leap of faith,” said the mother of two young children, “but we’re going to see it through.”
Her startup, Planet Ranch, is a business that would create and manufacture meatless and dairy-free foods. But it is also a place to learn sustainable practices and education.
“I’ve been cooking since I was 10, and I’ve had a farm since I was 20,” Klug said.
Most recently, she was a supervisor of the commissary kitchen at Shoreline Foods in Avondale, where she oversaw food preparation for several prestigious restaurants in Chicago.
Now she wants to do her part to address the “15 percent of the world that consumes 80 percent of the world’s resources.”
A self-described vegan and “tea-drinking hippie” who graduated from Columbia College Chicago, Klug had the idea of making plant-based proteins that are sustainable, tasty and healthy.
It’s a big dream. The start-up company would also include an education center to teach and educate others on sustainable practices.
But she’s no stranger to “impossible” tasks. In college, she helped start Zoe & Jane, a locally owned vegan deli on the North Side. She also operates Wild Rice Farm, a community garden and farm located in Bucktown.
In addition, she works at Youth in Action Chicago, where she works with high school students and teachers who use food as a way to teach academic and life skills.
“I’m blessed to be in Chicago at this time to see food for social justice,” Klug said. “But there’s a need for it in the West Side as well.”
During her career, Klug has seen the negative impacts of food on communities in need, where high rates of diabetes and obesity are the result of a lack of fresh, healthy foods.
As a part of her nonprofit, she helps schools and other organizations grow food locally.
“In the last five years, I’ve seen the growth of local food systems, especially in Chicago,” Klug said. “Now’s the time to bring in a really smart business model.”
Klug’s idea for the business stems from this need. The plan is to make, market and sell plant-based proteins as a healthy, sustainable product. Her business plan was selected from hundreds of submissions for the competition, which was held from April 9-17 and is in its ninth year.
“Planet Ranch could become an example for how businesses can move to a more sustainable system, where all people can participate,” she said.
With an Indiegogo campaign in the works, she is looking for investors and volunteers.
With the support of law firms and organizations, the Legal Food Frenzy serves as a national competition for corporations and legal groups. As they compete, they collect nonperishable foods and raise awareness of hunger and food insecurity.
The Chicago awards program, which is organized by the Greater Chicago Food Depository, awarded $120,000 to the 15 finalists.
The top prize of $20,000 will go to the finalist that collects the most non-perishable foods.
But Klug said this is only a part of the reason she wanted to submit her business plan.
“I don’t want a handout,” she said. “But I want the food insecurity problem to be addressed.”
Donations are being accepted at the Planet Ranch website. The Food Depository is also accepting donations.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,000 - Prompt 10: Amidst the ruins of the old castle, a
2024-09-25 03:19:42,000 - Generated text:  few isolated peasants were living; an elderly woman was selling wooden vessels to a group of villagers who were gathering in the yard around her. Her daughters were sitting among the crowd; their well-clothed bodies and proud smiles told of their gentle hearts. These daughters were victims of the former despotic, but good ruler who expelled his son to take over the reign, and now wished to punish the innocent. The old peasant woman, having sung the three girls’ praises, hoped to make them more beautiful by imparting a few secrets of her art.
The eldest daughter begged for the least beautiful beard, and the prettiest moustache and side-whiskers; the second daughter wished for a handsome smile, and the third that she might be as thin as the skeleton, as light as a feather, and as lively as a tree in the wind. Now, the mother got the work to do; the girl’s parts were cut out, and here and there the cuts were sewn up with thread and needle, and left open. Then the girls were clothed in the most beautiful clothes, and the elderly woman began her work of enchantment.
First, she took a large, flat basket and tied some black, crinkly pebbles to its bottom. Next, she pulled a threaded pine-needle out of the basket, and, after that, she seized a few fur-coats and put them on the pine-needles, putting them all together into a large box.
She placed the box in a corner of the room, and turned towards the old ruler, saying, “You will find a pair of white gloves. These are to protect you, when you throw down the beard and mustache.”
The girls heard this last, and, filled with the wildest joy, flew about in circles. When the old ruler had the beard and mustache in his hand, he threw them down into the box and felt glad. The pine-needles sprouted upwards, and became a large bunch of flowers, on which many birds began to perch, uttering the sweetest melodies.
All the children ran out to the yard, and immediately the three girls disappeared from the doorstep and could not be seen again. The old woman continued, “The swallow wants to break his wings and become a fish. When the cat sings to him, he wants to fly away. He is flying to the green stork, who stands on the boat of the sun and asks him to fly to a beautiful meadow, where pink roses are blooming.
“‘You mustn’t be scared,’ the stork says, ‘a swan is sitting there on the flowers, and now that you have your beautiful new wings, you will be his wife. But the swan runs away; when the cat sees that, he jumps in to look for him, but he can’t find him, so he runs away himself.’
“Then he runs to the field of carrots and turnips and calls out, ‘Let the cat come in and he will dance with the queen of all the animals.’
“The cat runs in, where the tom-cat is sitting on a porcelain plate. He is so frightened, that he would like to run away, but the field of carrots and turnips comes after him, whereupon he finally runs up on the plate and begins to dance, whereupon the tiger, who has been lying there, jumps up and begins to dance also. Then he runs over to the dancing swan. The cat, seeing that, jumps up on his back, and now begins to fly like a swan.
“And, after a while, he flies up to the sun and asks to be able to sit on the wheel which he is turning, and the sun makes it possible for him. After that, he flies to the stormy clouds and asks them to break open and drop rain, so that he can pluck out the white pearls which are there. After that, he flies to a bright star, which he wants to eat. But it is too hot, so he eats some of the pearls, and afterwards he flies back to the gloves and tears himself away from the stormy clouds and says to the three young girls, ‘You may come to me, but I can’t come to you, and I can’t show you where my home is.’
“Now, when the girls wake up, they know that they are far, far away from home, but they do not yet know what has happened to them. They walk on and on, until they come to a great house with

The man lifted his head, puzzled by his train of thoughts. He’d never had a talent for abstract thinking, nor could he ever remember a time when he’d seriously exercised his imagination. Unfortunately, that meant he had no way of predicting the events that would follow. He wasn’t worried, though, for he could do nothing to prevent them from happening. In fact, he welcomed the idea of dying.
It was simply fate.

Great beginning. I would like to read more.
Looks great - I'd like to read more. :-)
Great begining, but I think the italics in this excerpt might be too distracting...
It's kind of jarring when I read "Hmm" in italics. Not to mention it's not exactly a dialogue tag. I think "the man's thoughts were..." works just as well and keeps the flow a bit better.
But maybe that's just me. :)

Kate Evangelista November 11, 2011 at 10:27 AM
Thanks guys! ^_^
Your first instinct about the italics is right on. I was all set to make it a dialogue tag but then decided to change it to first person past tense. It definitely is a little distracting. :)
Thanks for the heads up! I really appreciate you guys pointing that out. :)
Margo Kelly November 11, 2011 at 10:39 AM
I'd like to see more. :)
Sometimes you just have to make your italics to sound different or in another way, or in the same way. Otherwise, italics can feel too much like screaming. Your italics feel natural and it's a cool way to start the story. And I agree with Kate. This is a tense paragraph that is dragging.
Lena April 11, 2012 at 11:49 PM
I had to read this three times before it made sense to me... I was thinking, "Huh, what's with the grammar?" And I was never sure if I was reading a first person POV. Maybe having italics to denote thoughts instead of writing in 1st POV is a good idea. I read the lines as he was telling us in italics what he was thinking, and what came to mind? Who is "we"? I was never sure if it was first or third person.
I'm not saying you need to change it or anything. But I thought I'd share my thoughts on it. And I was always a little confused until it finally made sense to me...
I love this kind of stuff. It's just a little vague, and I was always lost on how to read it until I finally got it. Not sure if you're trying to make it read weirdly or what, but maybe it's the idea you're trying to convey, and you're just putting it into words that are difficult to decipher.
I didn't see the difference between "he" and "the man" either.
I'd like to see more. Hope I'm making sense...

Eva, I'd like to see more too.
He would eventually put two and two together and get four. Awesome! I love this one. I can already imagine what's going to happen next. I think the beginning is tough to write because you don't want to give away too much of the story at once. I'd like to see what happens next. :)

2024-09-25 03:19:42,000 - Prompt 14: During a virtual reality game gone wrong, players must escape a fantasy world by solving
2024-09-25 03:19:42,000 - Generated text:  puzzles and moving through stages. Adventure-seeking businessman Brian David Goldner came up with the concept for the game after getting stuck in virtual reality.
As a result, he launched Labyrinth Adventure, a multiplayer virtual reality game that provides a 3D adventure and allows players to escape a virtual maze using wands to guide their way.
Brian D. Goldner is the founder of Labyrinth Adventure, a game in which players become engulfed in an immersive virtual reality game, complete with avatars, mazes, and points to earn. For Goldner, who is a fan of both gaming and virtual reality, it was a natural fit to create a game that would take players on an adventure.
In this adventure, players take the role of a time-traveling character who is given the opportunity to go back in time to correct a mistake and save the world from certain destruction. However, the player is not given many clues as to how to solve the puzzles and escape the labyrinth.
In the game, players must find their way through a maze of rooms, solve puzzles, and find clues. To do this, players must use the wand controllers to guide their way. The wand controllers are similar to the ones used in other virtual reality games, such as Elevate VR, where they can be moved left and right, up and down, and rotated to look around the room.
Each room has its own puzzle, and players must find their way through the maze to find the exit. The game is set in a fantasy world, and the mazes are filled with fantastical creatures and items. The puzzles are both mentally challenging and physically taxing, and players must be quick and agile to avoid becoming lost in the maze.
The game is designed for multiple players, and up to four players can play at once. However, due to the nature of the game, only one player can enter a room at a time.
While the game is set in a fantasy world, players are required to wear Virtual Reality headsets in order to fully immerse themselves in the game. In addition to the wand controllers, players must wear gloves in order to experience the game as if they were actually there.
There are a few ways to play Labyrinth Adventure, including public and private sessions. In a public session, players can sign up and join a game room at a time. The game will automatically create a new room every 15 minutes, and a player can leave the game whenever they want. The game has a private mode, where players can set up their own rooms and invite their friends to join.
In addition to the game itself, the Labyrinth Adventure company offers a custom-built Virtual Reality (VR) experience. This experience takes place in a room where players are given a briefing on how the game works. The room then lights up and the player is transported into the game. The experience lasts approximately an hour, and includes a demo of the game.
The Labyrinth Adventure game has been praised for its immersive gameplay and storyline. It has been called a “puzzle adventure” game that is perfect for the whole family. The game has received a positive response from both consumers and critics alike.
Labyrinth Adventure, a virtual reality game developed by Brian D. Goldner, is a game that offers an immersive experience for players. With a combination of puzzle-solving and maze-running, this game is sure to provide a thrilling experience for players. It also offers an opportunity for players to escape from reality and immerse themselves in a virtual world. Labyrinth Adventure is the perfect game for those looking for an immersive experience.

When Dimple wins a sweepstakes to visit a magical library, she wakes up to find herself trapped. She and her fellow authors — D.J. MacHale, Alan Gratz, and Deborah Underwood — have been captured by the Writer’s Block, an eccentric collection of villains (like zombie Charles Dickens, sarcastic Edgar Allan Poe, and the evil queen from “Snow White”).
Before they can be made into books and forced to serve as characters forever, Dimple and her authors escape, accompanied by friendly literary monsters and guided by a ragtag group of children, all the way to the top of the universe to save themselves and the universe as they know it.
John August is a New York Times bestselling author of over twenty novels, screenplays, and picture books for children. He wrote the screenplays for Charlie’s Angels, Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, Corpse Bride, and Frankenweenie. John lives in California with his family.
Alan Gratz is the New York Times bestselling author of the critically acclaimed books Blitzed and Projekt 1065, as well as the highly-anticipated middle grade fantasy-mystery series Infinity Ring, which is now a groundbreaking series from the makers of National Geographic.
Deborah Underwood has written more than two dozen books for children, including Dogs U Make My Day! and Here Comes the Easter Cat. She lives in Oakland, CA.
“Fast-paced and fun, and sure to leave readers asking for more.” – School Library Journal
“Although the magical librarian herself does not appear on every page, there’s a feeling of magic on every one. The cast of characters, including author and villain, are all marvelously original… A buoyant romp through the universe with readers enjoying every minute of the adventure.” — Kirkus Reviews, starred review
“Literary lovers are sure to enjoy this epic journey with an ending that will send readers off in search of the next book.” – School Library Journal
“With themes of friendship, self-sacrifice, and the power of knowledge, this… should attract fans of Rick Riordan and Garth Nix.” – Publishers Weekly
“The notion that books truly come to life is a familiar one, but rarely done as thoughtfully as in this book… Adventure, fun, and insight are on every page, but particularly in the back half, which is packed with incredible peril and entertaining writing… An absolute gem of a book.” – Booklist, starred review
“The madcap adventure is rife with twists and turns, but never loses sight of the real heroes at the heart of the story: readers.” – Horn Book Magazine, starred review
“… An action-packed adventure that will appeal to reluctant readers.” — Kirkus Reviews
“… A one-of-a-kind story featuring some of literature’s greatest characters, and a few not so great. Though it all, however, is unmistakably August, one of the best storytellers around. A can’t miss treat.” — Rated Reviews
“August skillfully draws in readers and never lets go, ending this first book with a cliff-hanger that leaves readers on the edge of their seats.” – Kirkus Reviews
“Utterly unique and clever, The Infinite Worlds of John August will keep you guessing with a storyline that is both magical and original. The inclusion of famous literary characters is seamless and imaginative. Adventure and danger lurk around every page, and the story is bursting with a mix of action and laugh-out-loud humor. August’s middle-grade debut is a can’t-miss for tweens, and all those who love and appreciate the world of books.” — Mike Mason, author of Wired for Books: Literacy, Technology, and Everyday Life
“The Infinite Worlds of John August is an enchanting adventure that’s a love letter to reading and writing, and an unforgettable friendship story. Fans of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett will revel in the many jokes about the magical qualities of books. And readers young and old will cherish this brilliant novel about imagination, creativity,

2024-09-25 03:19:42,000 - Generated text:  first draft in January. I had a much more difficult time pacing myself for the first draft.
The publisher's editorial staff liked the book, but thought it needed more research on military topics. There was only one woman in the service who was allowed to work with a drafting table and as she only typed in script, nobody, least of all the typists could figure out how to decipher it.
The novelist typed the final words of the first draft in January. I had a much more difficult time pacing myself for the first draft. In real life, the number of chapters fluctuates widely, and no novelist worth his salt ever gives chapter length more than passing thought.
The novelist spent a great deal of time on the book, but the editors of the publisher felt the first draft had too many details, and ordered some cuts. The author felt that it was the details that gave the story its authenticity. Then, one by one, she let go of her characters, she released the book to her agents.
All of them suggested that the manuscript needed more depth, the publisher said it needed more editing, and her agent told her to do another draft. In real life, authors are rarely satisfied with the first draft, but in the novelist's world she had just presented her best, to a publisher that never makes mistakes.
In real life, the publisher's editors wanted the book to be thicker, but the writer thought it worked as is. The editor never had any suggestion as to what should be added or what should be eliminated.
But the agent's clients complained that it was too thin. The writer was always saying how much she needed to cut it down. And the publisher agreed, telling her to send them the first draft. I kept hoping my manuscript would end up with a reader who, with the help of some gentle suggestions, could help me tighten it up, but instead the book was set up to fail.
In real life, I was asked to add more detail, but they never said which parts they wanted more of or why they wanted more. However, my agent was also sending the manuscript to different agents, so that a certain number of them would have it at the same time.
The novelist's publisher set up a meeting with her agent. She was concerned about the book, she loved the characters, she loved the emotional arc of the story. As a reader, I was concerned that the setting had never been realized.
I had a good time and the book had an audience. I tried to add more detail, to make the setting come alive. The first time I tried to add any detail, however, it confused the other agents.
I struggled to add detail to the story, but my agent kept telling me I needed to make my story more exciting and move more quickly. Then the book was sent to the agent's readers.
But I was trying to see what it felt like to have my own first draft, and how I could begin to change it to something that worked better as a finished piece.
My agent started querying other agents, which helped raise my profile, but didn't get me anywhere. In real life, I'm just beginning my career as a published author. My writing career is only beginning, but so far it's going well.
And the agent's readers just wanted to read the next chapter. I knew that, as the writer, I would have to take responsibility for the book, but I didn't understand why it had to be me. I thought it would be the agent who would have to fix it.
The publisher wanted to discuss the changes that needed to be made, and they suggested that I needed to spend more time with my characters. One of the agents told me to keep them on a page for a certain amount of time, because this was the way they could tell how interesting they were.
The novelist began cutting back, but the novel wasn't as strong as she had thought. She added back some of the deleted scenes and changed the ending to make it more dramatic.
The next draft had more scenes, but they were still too short. The first draft was only two chapters. In real life, the manuscript that I began in January and finished by April was my first draft. The publisher's editors like to cut back on the scenes that weren't working, but they also wanted more depth.
In real life, I was pretty happy with my first draft. I was trying to figure out what the characters were feeling and thinking, how to write a realistic setting, and what to do with all the plot points. I sent a chapter from the book to the publisher, and they were very enthusiastic about it.
I liked my characters, I was trying to bring them to

2024-09-25 03:19:42,000 - Prompt 17: Hidden within the ancient texts lies
2024-09-25 03:19:42,000 - Generated text:  a whole world of legend, mythology, history, mystery, and power. I have always been fascinated by the mystical quality of the texts, and their complex symbolism, but it has been a constant struggle for me to read them in their original language and not fall asleep during the tedious stories. And then there is always the annoying language barrier that always forces me to seek help from online translators, which although helpful, often end up being pretty literal translations.
Now, with the arrival of the Ancient Texts: The Essential Collection from Inkstone, the frustrating search for information regarding mythology and philosophy is a thing of the past. This book contains in-depth explanations of the symbolism behind the myths, the underlying concepts of philosophy, and the elaborate meanings of symbols and archetypes. It gives us a fascinating peek into the more esoteric aspects of these texts, and it is a wonderful tool for those who are interested in mythology, philosophy, or ancient religious practices. The only downside to this book is that it does not contain the stories as they appear in the ancient texts themselves, which means that if you are looking to learn about the Hindu god Shiva and his legends, you will find all the information that you need in this book, but it will be spread out over 18 different pages. This means that you will have to either read the whole book, or find another book to supplement the information you have found in this one. The only other thing that I could have wished for was an index at the back of the book, so I could easily locate certain topics.
The Ancient Texts: The Essential Collection from Inkstone is the perfect tool for anyone looking to gain a more in-depth knowledge about ancient religions and philosophy. The book contains numerous excerpts from ancient texts, as well as commentaries, analyses, and summaries of the content. There are also copious illustrations that bring to life the legends, myths, and cultural practices of ancient civilizations. This is a book that anyone interested in the study of ancient religions and cultures will find fascinating, and it will be a useful tool for anyone looking to supplement their existing knowledge.
The Pocket Guide to North American Aquatic Invertebrates by Judy Fearing is a very detailed and informative book for anyone interested in learning more about the various aquatic invertebrates found in North America. The book is written in an easy to read format, and includes plenty of detailed pictures and drawings to help the reader get a better understanding of each species. The book also includes a glossary of terms and a list of references for further reading.
This is a very good book for anyone interested in learning more about the many aquatic invertebrates found in North America. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the subject.
The United States of America is one of the most diverse countries in the world. With a rich and complex history, it is a country that is filled with many different stories. Each state has its own unique history, and each state has its own unique story to tell.
In 2018, author Jon Weiner set out to capture the unique stories of each of the 50 states in one comprehensive book. The result was "Stories of the United States of America: An Interview with 50 of America's Most Influential Leaders, Storytellers, and Visionaries," a book that was named one of the Best Books of 2018 by The New York Times.
In this book, Weiner interviews 50 of the most influential people in America. These people range from the most famous politicians and celebrities to the everyday people who have helped to shape the United States. Each interview is accompanied by a detailed photo and a brief biography.
The book is organized into five sections, each covering a different aspect of the United States. The first section covers the early years of the country, from the early settlers to the Civil War. The second section covers the 20th century, from the Great Depression to the present day. The third section covers the state-by-state history of the United States, from the founding of each state to the present day. The fourth section covers the American people, from the everyday people who have helped to shape the United States to the famous
This is an absolutely amazing book! It is full of interesting stories, anecdotes, and facts. It is well written and easy to read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in American history.
I found this book to be very interesting. It covers a wide range of topics and does so in a very concise and interesting manner. I would highly recommend

2024-09-25 03:19:42,001 - Generated text:  never reaches, swim vast schools of glowing creatures. More than two thousand species of these luminescent deep sea creatures have been found, and a new report reveals that they are at greater risk of extinction than ever before.
Scientists at Lund University in Sweden have undertaken the first-ever global assessment of the threat facing these fantastical life forms. Publishing their findings in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series, the team says that several key factors pose a significant threat to the continued existence of these amazing organisms.
Threats such as fishing, pollution, disease and climate change could put 10 percent of all these species in danger. With hundreds more species still to be discovered, that represents a substantial risk.
"There are over 2,000 known species, but we still have a lot to learn about them," says lead author Nick Haddock from Lund University in Sweden. "We are a long way from seeing how many species we have in the deep ocean."
A deeper look at the origins and evolution of the deep sea creatures reveals a unique set of traits that may have allowed for the unexpected wide range of different species. As there is much less light, heat and carbon dioxide at those depths than at the surface, creatures here have adapted to more extreme conditions.
When light is absent, organisms have evolved light-emitting abilities. As oxygen is scarce, creatures have developed other ways of making energy through processes such as nitrate reduction, sulfide oxidation or methane oxidation. Other common traits include light sensitivity, biofluorescence, vertical migration, lack of swim bladders and unusual chemical defense mechanisms.
Haddock and his colleagues looked at 2,243 species of glowing creatures from all five oceans, ranging in size from 250 micrometers to 60 meters (0.09 inches to 200 feet).
They found that 20 percent of these species were exposed to some form of direct or indirect pressure from fishing. This includes the activities of trawl and bottom set fisheries, which pull up huge amounts of fish and other organisms from the seabed as they search for prey. The scientists say that this practice in particular was the biggest single contributor to the increased risk of these species.
Sea pollution and habitat degradation were also found to have an impact on a fifth of all deep sea life, with anthropogenic diseases, climate change and exploitation for recreational diving added to the list.
"It is a very significant amount," says Haddock, "especially when you consider that this is the most threatened taxonomic group on Earth."
Scientists are not sure just how much of an impact climate change will have on these creatures. They might be limited to very specific temperatures or pressures, but could also potentially withstand a wide range of them.
But even if these creatures were to evolve to adapt to rising temperatures, the report says that they are likely to be severely affected by the resulting acidification of the oceans.
The good news, however, is that this study represents a major step forward in understanding the impacts of humanity on marine life, as Haddock adds: "Glowing deep-sea creatures are the least studied groups of animals in the sea. This is the first time that we've been able to quantify the scale of the threats to these animals, using new global data."
The team has plans to continue the assessment, and aims to publish the next report by 2020.
The video below is an educational look at deep sea bioluminescence.
This article has been updated to reflect that it is the first time threats to these animals have been assessed globally.
Our ocean is full of beautiful and bizarre animals. If you're planning to explore the depths, here's what to look out for.
These two New Zealand dudes think dolphins are cool, so they built a machine to test that theory.
Glow-in-the-dark life is far more widespread than we thought. A recent study has shown that nearly 10 percent of sea creatures produce their own light, giving scientists clues about how they live.
This weird looking tube-like creature looks like it's made of junk food, but it's actually a blue bioluminescent deep sea fish. Here's what else you might see on the ocean's bottom.

Vashti Brownfield put the beer down, giving up on the unrealistic hope that she would be able to get a second sip. She took another sip of the water next to her. She had not touched the other alcoholic beverage.
Taylor was five minutes late. No doubt, she was checking out the room to make sure her presentation was to her satisfaction. At least, she had a hundred bucks to buy herself a bottle of wine before she went home.
She had thought, the old her would have been consumed by the new her by now. The old her would have figured out a way to take over the presentation. She would have made excuses for Taylor. But the old her could not have. She had nothing to say to anyone to cover for Taylor's laziness. She knew how the new her reacted to laziness.
The new her was full of sympathy for anyone who was not working hard enough. The old her knew that was not a virtue.
Taylor's phone rang.
Vashti's head turned towards the sound of the voice. Vashti was consumed with jealousy. She knew the new her would be jealous of Taylor's phone. The new her would be mad that it was the only thing Taylor seemed to care about.
"Yes," the new her said to the phone, "Taylor said to meet me here."
Vashti knew the voice and remembered that it was Taylor's mother. The older woman sounded calmer than usual, but she was still giving orders. Vashti's gaze moved from Taylor to the phone, which she had not moved from her ear.
"I'm sorry," Taylor said, "I had to answer this. She had something important to say."
"She has something important to say all the time."
The new her was offended, but she did not say anything. She had not said anything to the old her when she heard her mother on the phone. She had just talked to her mother for thirty minutes. Taylor said they were still working on a project, but there had not been a project since Vashti had moved in with her.
"Taylor," the older woman said, "I was supposed to call you earlier."
"It's fine. We'll do it later."
"It's about your father. I called your dad this morning to see if he had seen or heard anything from him."
"I have not heard from him," Taylor said.
The old her said, "If he calls, just let me know."
"Why?" Vashti asked.
"You don't know? What happened, Taylor?" the mother said.
"I don't know what you're talking about," the younger woman said.
"Your father called a few days ago. He said he was worried about him and wanted to see how things were going."
Vashti nodded. She had not told her daughter that the man called her and she did not think she needed to. If Taylor had been disturbed, she would have told her, and the old her knew that if Taylor did not bring it up, she did not want to know. She would always wait for her.
"He said he wanted to see him," the mother said. "I don't know if he wants to see him because he is doing badly or because he wants something from him."
"I don't care," Taylor said, "as long as he's okay."
"Taylor," the older woman said, "I do not understand you sometimes. I told him you were too involved to be able to help, so he asked me to find out what is going on for him."
"For me?" the younger woman said. "Why is he doing that? I did not do anything to him."
"No, it's not about you," the mother said, "It's about the world. The world does not like people like him."
"What do you mean?" Taylor said. "What has he done?"
"I don't know, Taylor. I'm going to tell him it was a mistake to involve me in this."
"You have to stop asking me," Taylor said. "I know you can't stop, but I do not want to be the cause of problems between you and him. You're going to have to find a different way of getting things from him."

Growing up in a Catholic working-class neighborhood on the west side of Chicago, I had never heard of birth control pills, abortions, or sexual liberation for women. However, during my first summer away from home in Crawfordsville, Indiana, at a new-age, alternative high school for gifted and talented teens, I got to know a number of girls, and their view of sex was very different from mine. These young women wanted sexual freedom, and they intended to get it. They knew that the church prohibited it, but they saw this prohibition as a denial of their rights, and a product of misogyny. They were committed to make their own decisions about sex, and they intended to be in control of their own bodies.
A number of us decided to use birth control pills, but it was very complicated. We were not just living in a sexually repressive society, we were also living in a society that was profoundly sexist. The whole social system seemed designed to give men authority over women, while women were supposed to defer to the authority of men. So getting birth control pills was no easy matter. In the public places, like drugstores and supermarkets, birth control pills were behind the counter, in the back. You had to ask for them, and provide identification. If you were under eighteen, you had to show your school ID. But with your ID, no one under eighteen could buy a pack of cigarettes. This made no sense, but that was the way it was.
Then there were the restrictions on women regarding medical care. In this highly conservative society, pregnant women could not be treated unless they had a written letter from their doctor, and in my experience, that meant that women often suffered terrible consequences for wanting to control their own reproductive lives. It's pretty hard to get an abortion, too. If you want an abortion, you are often faced with a long struggle to figure out how to get one. Most of these restrictive laws are written in such a way that if a person can find one person to argue that there is no need for abortion, they can keep the doors closed. With access to these abortions so restricted, women were often forced to either live with the consequences of unintended pregnancies, or to get illegal abortions. They were considered brave when they did it themselves. But if you knew someone who had died because she had had an illegal abortion, you would know the truth behind that brave talk. It was heroic, certainly, to be determined to do something that you knew was dangerous, but there is another dimension of heroism that involves doing something you know is wrong and should not be done.
In the absence of these life-threatening dangers, there is no question about who is the real hero, those who are willing to put their lives on the line for the sake of freedom, or those who claim to be liberated while contributing to the chains of slavery. This is a very clear picture of spiritual heroism. Those who choose the lesser path are like those people who claim to be Jesus lovers while cursing the people Jesus loves, the poor. Or like those people who try to take credit for the looting and vandalism of unjustly evicted renters by calling them, “Black Lives Matter protesters.”
Sexual liberation for women was a very heroic thing to achieve. Yet, this was one aspect of a larger cultural struggle. The women's movement wasn't just about sexual liberation. It was also about gender equality. Women wanted to have a real voice, not just to be heard, but to be regarded as equal to men, and this was not easy for many men to accept.
There were powerful social forces at work against the women's movement. Men were willing to put up a brave face for the sake of their daughters, but behind closed doors, men often called women “f

“Oh, hello, there,” he says. He wears white shirt, black jeans, and a silver pendant with a red stone. His hair is black and messy, his head is covered with bandages.
“Hey, kid,” he says. He has a real confidence about him. “So, are you looking for me or am I just following you?”
“Well, what do you want?” Sinclair turns around. “We shouldn’t talk here, and besides, it’s not safe.”
“Hey, I know where you’re going. My grandpa is about to kick some ass and we need your help.” He moves closer to her, and the slight breeze made her hair flip. He didn’t seem to mind her being so close.
Sinclair glanced at him. “Where is your grandpa?”
“In that bar you just walked past,” he said.
Sinclair smirks. “Oh, now that sounds interesting. What’s his name?”
“Ah, I see. And why should I help you?”
“I’ll tell you the secret of how to create a garden where only flowers grow,” he said.
“Oh,” she said. He did seem to know about her wish. “Well, I could probably use some help in beating him. I’ve never fought a demon before.”
He smiles. “You and me, then.”

2024-09-25 03:19:42,001 - Generated text: , sometimes changing gears as they went along. It was an exhilarating feeling to be speeding down the road as fast as they could go. Cars from different eras drove by and the car just kept speeding up. And no one noticed. They were all too busy talking to each other. It was a week before the reunion and their conversation went back and forth as they headed for the airport. A boy on a scooter rode by with an ear bud in and the duo didn't pay attention to him. They kept up their conversation. One of them hadn't been back to his hometown in thirty years.
"You'll see," the boy said excitedly, as the other talked, "it hasn't changed at all. Everyone's the same. If you look close enough, you'll see things from back then, and if you look hard enough you'll find me."
Everyone was so happy to see each other. As the old cars made their way to the town they went to high school in, they all remembered things that had happened. One boy had had his first kiss on a football field. Another had started a romance that wasn't meant to be. One of the men had been home schooled and had grown up without knowing most of the people around him. Another had been born into a family of musicians. All of these stories and more would be told that weekend.
The next day, a man drove up in a convertible with his girlfriend in the passenger's seat. The two got out and grabbed suitcases from the trunk. The girlfriend didn't want to go in and the man wouldn't let her back in. They walked into the apartment together, still arguing. They were yelling now. She said he was being a dick and he called her a pussy. He tried to make up by saying he was just kidding. She walked away. The man got the kids ready and the pair headed out.
"The band's doing well," the man said. "It was hard at first. No one knew who we were." He laughed. "Now everyone knows us. We're even selling tickets. We're going to be making a lot of money."
They parked the car in the lot. Kids played outside and all of the cars were arranged in a way to let the fans in. Everything had been very carefully planned to make the reunion perfect.
The man walked with the kids over to the reunion and they waited in line to go in. He got tickets from a volunteer and the kids headed inside. They got onto a ride that took them into a room with no windows. The room was dark and the sound of crickets could be heard. They had entered an enclosed world. The ride stopped and the man got off with the kids. They were inside a pitch black room. All that could be heard were crickets chirping and other insects.
"This is how my family lives," he said to the kids. "There's no windows. No lights. Everything is dark. They think they're protecting themselves from the world. I don't get it. We should be outside." He had one of the kids put on a blindfold. "Can you see me?" he said. "Not yet, you will."
The kids felt around and tried to get some sense of where the man was. They stood in the dark for a few moments until one of the kids heard the man start to walk away. They followed the sound of his steps. The sound was getting quieter and quieter. They took the blindfold off and realized that he was gone. The man led them back into the light and they found themselves once again at the reunion.
The man told the kids to go inside and buy their reunion tickets. They said goodbye to the man. The kids ran into the main building. The man ran after them. He tried to get to them but his footsteps got louder and louder as he came up behind them.
"I have to be outside," he said. "It's my choice. I can't take it anymore. I can't take this life I'm living anymore. I'm a mess." He got to the main hall. The kids were gone. He was still searching for them. He could no longer see the light. He had never left the darkness.
The boy and the man were driving in the car. The boy was turning the knobs on the radio. He hadn't seen his friend for a while and the two were talking. They drove through different neighborhoods and it was almost dusk. The car was moving

2024-09-25 03:19:42,002 - Generated text:  ecosystems that remain largely untouched, inspiring awe and wonder in the diversity of life forms that exist. Ecologists and marine scientists continue to study the ocean for the many things it provides, such as clean water and food resources. Some areas in the ocean remain largely untouched by humans, allowing biologists to discover new species and better understand our oceans. You will take part in a virtual reality experience that transports you to some of the most remote places on Earth, allowing you to discover the vast depths of the ocean and see the wonder of life, as well as the threats it faces. This course will explore how the ocean's deep waters may hold the key to discovering new medicines and how ocean floors may be a solution to waste and pollution problems on land.
Even the oceans have a depth limit: More than 20,000 feet below the surface is where no light penetrates. At these depths, there are unique biological communities with new species that have evolved in ways different from shallow-water ecosystems. In this module, we will explore the fascinating biological communities of the deep sea. We will travel to the Marianas Trench, the world’s deepest point, and learn how marine scientists use creative tools to observe and sample these remote locations.
In this module, you will take a virtual reality trip to the Mariana Trench. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) define how the deep sea is identified; (2) explain the importance of using creative tools to study the deep sea; and (3) list the most common creatures found at extreme depths of the ocean.
Before we travel to the deep sea in this module, we’ll explore the oceans around Hawaii, our home state. We’ll meet fisherman Dennis Kahele, who was inspired by Hanauma Bay (on Oahu) to found HIKO Laboratories, which does ecological research at extreme depths around Hawaii. Dr. Tony Schetelich will introduce us to the unique ecosystems of the Hawaiian deep sea, and we’ll also meet Kyle Grine, a filmmaker who captured underwater footage of deep-sea Hawaii.
In this module, you will take a virtual reality trip to Kona, Hawaii. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) define what the continental shelf is; (2) list at least three creatures found on the continental shelf; and (3) list at least three concerns about deep-sea biological communities.
By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) define what a shoreline is; and (2) list the concerns about biological communities on shorelines.
In this module, we will learn about what the word ecology means and how different ecosystems are related. We will also meet Dr. Alexis Morin, who is a coral reef ecologist and lead author of the UNESCO report How to Save the Ocean. Then, you will take a virtual reality trip to Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) define what an ecosystem is; (2) define what it means to have biodiversity; (3) list three ways human activity can have a negative impact on marine ecosystems; and (4) list three ways we can help protect marine ecosystems.
In this module, you will learn about phytoplankton and how these microscopic plants form the base of oceanic food webs. We will also meet Dr. Jonathan White, an oceanographer from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who has created a technique that uses carbon isotopes to track and monitor plankton. This new method can help us understand how oceans are responding to climate change.
By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) define what phytoplankton are; (2) explain the importance of phytoplankton in the ocean ecosystem; (3) list at least three concerns related to ocean acidification and warming; and (4) list at least three ways we can help protect phytoplankton.
In this module, you will travel to Easter Island, where native seagrass meadows help protect the coral reef from erosion. Then, you will travel to Kāneohe Bay on Oahu to learn how native seagrasses are being restored. You will also meet Kelly Chock, an HUI Fellow and undergraduate

2024-09-25 03:19:42,002 - Generated text:  no views that would be worth while. The descending path eventually became more of an uphill trudge as the villages on the hillsides grew smaller and smaller and the houses on the steepest of hills became houses that were barely more than a single room with a roof. The lifestyle was shocking, and the indifference to the foreigners watching made it even more shocking. There were no paved roads or government buildings and there were no jobs in a town that was, at best, small and isolated. We asked a number of people if we could stay with them in their homes and while we understood that we would have to stay in the family's sleeping quarters, there was never a reply. A lot of people just seemed to ignore us when we were in close proximity. We wandered down through the streets looking for any sign of a hotel or of anyone offering accommodation, but there was nothing. The public transit schedule was simply not valid for visitors in the town and no one seemed to want to spend time trying to explain it. We walked to the base of the gondola in order to see what we could see. The gondola was not running and the workers there told us that it had been closed for the season. It is one thing for rural places in the United States to operate on a seasonal basis, but it is quite another for a town's lifeline to be unavailable for any reason other than those dictated by Mother Nature. There is no electricity, no running water, no phone service and no businesses of any kind in this town that tourists can patronize. There are some remote farm houses scattered about, but it is not clear that the families who live there even use the homes as their permanent residences.
We carried on through the town and down the road, and stopped to visit the two temples which seemed to be the only buildings in town that did not seem to be in disrepair. We never did make it to the mountains or even see the source of the gorge, but we did spend some time walking the streets and absorbing the sights. We felt compelled to ask how far it was to the nearest town, which was not the village in which we had found ourselves. When we asked, the answer that we received was "two days." It was either a significant exaggeration, or else there was no other place for us to go. After all, we were within walking distance of the China/North Korea border, but we were going nowhere. It was a sobering thought that we were really stranded in this remote corner of North Korea.
We descended the road to the area along the river where we had found a place to camp that evening. We followed the river down the valley for a few kilometers, eventually arriving in a much more populated area. We were greeted by an old farmer who told us that we could stay in the family home for two hours, but then we would have to leave. We told him that we were simply going to camp and he seemed surprised. He led us to a spot down the bank from the farmyard, where a pile of branches had been stacked on the edge of a stone wall. We spread our plastic tarps out in the yard to use as a covering for our damp belongings. The old man didn't say much, and we didn't say much to him. He had probably been approached by a number of Chinese tourists, but he couldn't have known that we were looking for a place to stay for more than a few hours. We thanked him for his help and gave him a thank-you, but he just nodded his head and we left the family home.
A couple of hours later we were back in the yard of our temporary lodging, setting up our tent. The sun was setting and it was freezing cold. In a small wooden building on the property was a large brick stove, which we thought might be used to burn wood in order to heat water. The man was walking around, and we greeted him again. We asked him again where we might find a place to stay, but he just shook his head. We didn't know what to make of it. It was the first time that we had ever been refused accommodation in any of the countries we were visiting, and the fact that it was coming from a man who probably hadn't seen foreigners before made it even more intriguing.
We bundled up, hoping that the Chinese people were wrong about the temperature. We were right about that, and it was brutally cold. We tried to ignore the stares of the locals as we slept, but it was hard. We were worried about our belongings, and the only solution we could come up with was to take turns standing guard. It was

The squirrel adds, "In blogosphere as in bacon, breakfast is a competitive world." Readers learn how the squirrel has a new breakfast on the first day of every month. The squirrel, who has mastered the English language, has a surprising ending in sight. In a message from the author, he says, "This book was originally written for a four-year-old, though it is appropriate for much younger readers." He also says he hopes the book will inspire young readers to enjoy reading.
In the original author's note, Suzzette Hansen speaks of her own blogging experience and how she blogs on Twitter. Her tweets contain hashtags for the various labels of her daily work, like #happyhour and #cocktails, but she decides to get rid of the hashtags to create this book. "It may have been a big decision, but hey, there are only so many #'s you can use before they become meaningless." The Squirrel and the Skunk will soon have their own hashtag.
Besides the charming illustrations, The Squirrel and the Skunk is a highly humorous introduction to blogging. It is sure to spark classroom discussions about blogs, cyberspace, and how "the world can be just a little bit smaller if you spend some time writing."

Angelina's Christmas by Katharine Holabird and Helen Craig
Angelina has an amazing imagination. In this holiday story, Angelina imagines that Mrs. Patchit has forgotten about Christmas. Angelina tries to find presents for all of her classmates. She makes snowmen for Lucille and Pecola, and for Albert she creates a new game. However, she is sad that Mrs. Patchit forgot Christmas. The class puts on a surprise show and plays songs on recorders. When Angelina goes up to Mrs. Patchit, the realization that she has forgotten Christmas is almost too much to bear. She surprises everyone by singing, and the surprise works. It is amazing what creativity can do.
This book reminds us how important it is to have those around us who are willing to forgive our mistakes and join us in our quest to do the right thing.
This book is also an excellent way to introduce some classic songs, like "Jingle Bells," "Up on the Housetop," and "We Wish You a Merry Christmas."

The Squirrel and the Skunk is the first book in Suzzette Hansen's blog book series. Anna McQuinn has written the text of the book, but I can tell you from experience that she has done a fantastic job. The squirrel that gets this blog series started is a very witty character, and you should look forward to his humor.
The Squirrel is a very professional blogger. It all starts when the squirrel is making his own granola. He tells us that he likes to make breakfast every Sunday morning. (No wonder he is a good blogger; he knows his own time frame!) The squirrel not only tells us what he does in his blogs, but he also tells us how to do it. He writes in a casual manner, and he explains why he does things the way he does. He also gives us a recipe for homemade granola at the end of his blog.
This book has the type of humor that is best for 4 to 8-year-olds. You have to have a very good sense of humor to appreciate it. I found myself laughing many times while I was reading this book, and I can't wait to see what other blogs the squirrel posts.
I would recommend this book for all early childhood educators, elementary school teachers, and parents of children 4 to 8 years old. I think parents should share this book with their children and let the children discuss it with them. The Squirrel and the Skunk is a good lesson for kids on blogging, and they will be able to relate to it if their parents do it, as well.

As soon as the workshop of Freya’s Light had been sold and the workers could tear down the building, its former inhabitants went their separate ways. But before the morning came when the final nail had been driven, most of them had met on the evening before to enjoy the farewell party that had been arranged by Efferet. It was the same week that the cherry trees had begun to blossom, so the group assembled under a tree as they drank lemonade and ate slices of cake. Although the place had been locked, Freya’s Light still gave off a wondrous, magical smell, and the scent had lingered in the workshop.

This lighthearted episode introduces Earth's technology and customs, including the practice of "knitting" as a means of "mending" and creating garments. It also briefly covers human concepts of time and space, namely how long it takes an alien ship to travel from Earth to Pluto and how a particular planet is so far away that it cannot be seen. As a parting gift, the alien also knits some "bloodsoaked" bandages.
This episode includes a conversation about the word "blood," including whether or not it's offensive. I think it was appropriate to talk about this, especially in light of more recent events where a high school teacher was suspended for allegedly using the word in class. I also added a quick coda at the end of the episode to address an issue that occurred when we were recording: the insensitivity of using the term "otherkin" when referring to someone who believes they are, essentially, a ghost. If you'd like to know more about the "otherkin" term, check out this New York Times article.
You can watch the episode below, and let us know what you think! We have a whole bunch of episodes planned for this year (12 in 2012), and I'm excited to share them with you. Please be sure to leave a comment on our homepage, too!

2024-09-25 03:19:42,003 - Generated text:  a single-celled organism that appears to be the missing link between inorganic material and life. After its untimely death, it becomes trapped in amber. Returning to Earth in 1946, the preserved specimen is unearthed at an archaeological dig in a small town in North Carolina. When a visitor arrives in the area, the young scientist that discovers the specimen at the dig is forced to face his deepest fears and the unspeakable consequences of the mysterious visitor’s nature.
The movie AMBER is set in both the past and the present, and in two seemingly different parts of the United States of America. In the North Carolina countryside in 1946, and in a fictionalized Los Angeles of the future. The duality in time, space and place is vital to the story of the movie.
Daniel M. Power
Mystery & Thriller, Sci-Fi, Horror
The story of AMBER has a very visceral, pulpy, action oriented tone in places. It should feel fast-paced, frantic, but in a cinematic way rather than a gritty hand-held way. We want to be immersed in the movie from the start, and it should feel cinematic from the opening shot. We want to feel the tension and atmosphere of the story right away. We want the audience to get hooked on the story right away, but at the same time, we don’t want the movie to feel too dark and serious. The movie should have its mysterious and horrific elements, but should also have elements of humor.
When you compare a modern independent sci-fi movie with the classic sci-fi movies from the 70’s and 80’s, you can see a world of difference in how the two approaches the genre. The modern independent sci-fi movies have either taken the biggest elements of those classic sci-fi movies and mashed them together to create something that feels hollow or cliche (with tons of action and CGI), or they have mashed together all the horrific elements of those movies into something that feels like a parody of the genre, trying to use all the buzz words and aspects of the genre and try to just pass them off as a new take on it.
AMBER is not trying to be a darker, scarier, or even actionier version of something you’ve seen before. AMBER is taking the best elements of a classic mystery/horror/sci-fi story, and making a new modern version. AMBER is modernizing those classic genres, bringing them together, and finding new ways to convey the elements of those classic films. AMBER will have action, horror, and sci-fi elements, but they will be utilized in a way that gives the story the emotional weight that these genre elements usually don’t have in movies today.

The movie AMBER is about unraveling mysteries and dealing with life-changing experiences.
The movie AMBER is about discovering the unknown and dealing with your emotions.
The movie AMBER is about the extremes of human behavior and our own inner nature.
One day I was going through a list of past and present civilizations that have existed all over the planet and thought to myself; imagine discovering the remains of the missing link in our own culture’s history, here in America, and being the first to scientifically research and study it. What would that be like? Then I began to think about how horrifying and creepy it would be to find something that the collective human race thought of as legendary and legendary beings that are capable of feats of inhuman strength and nature. I thought that if I were to imagine such a thing and try to put myself in that moment, I’d feel horrified and scared. The story of AMBER started to slowly build and form in my mind from that point.
The earliest draft of AMBER was written between March and May of 2016. I would say that I started working on AMBER in the summer of 2015, and then started the first draft of the screenplay in 2016.
I was born in Saint Louis, Missouri in the early 90’s and have lived all over the country, but mostly in New Mexico and Missouri. I moved to Los Angeles in 2012 to attend film school at the University of Southern California.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,003 - Generated text:  dozens of small traditional wineries, with many passages opening onto hidden wine cellars. These tiny taverns were small restaurants until the 1980s, when, following an initiative by the Municipality of Heraklion, they were designated protected areas where artisan wine making and serving was permitted, and taverns and restaurants alike were prohibited from opening. These artisan wineries have thus been preserved and are particularly charming as they showcase the original architecture of the city, enabling visitors to delve into its true history.
Most of the taverns (known locally as giannes) are located around the Venetian Wall, the palace and the port. The list of wineries has changed throughout the years, with new establishments opening and old ones closing down. The oldest wine establishment in Heraklion, KYMINARI, was founded in 1869 and, despite various modifications, remains a stronghold of the city's traditional wine making, a place where one can taste local wines and food. In 1989, several of these artisan wineries were declared Listed Heritage Buildings.
You can begin a tour around the city by visiting a number of these wineries, such as DIMITRIOS STAVROU, which was the first of the wineries to open. This is where the innovation began in the mid 1960s, as until then the city had over a hundred taverns. Today, however, most of the taverns have been replaced by banks, and DIMITRIOS STAVROU is now the oldest of the listed wineries.
Taverns once commonly called marboules in Heraklion used to be cozy spots where the owners and customers were always friendly and would be happy to share a traditional way of life and an appetite for genuine local food. These charming taverns included Agelou, Fournas, Lagos, Christakis, Giorgaki and Vovos. In more recent years, with increased tourism, more taverns have been opened that pay no attention to their traditional style and serve just as fast food. Among the new taverns, KLAIMENOS NAFSIKI, on Apostolou Pavlou street, is a very good choice.
MENSA 76 tavern has its own history. It started in 1960 in an old house in Gounari Square (now its new location) and is run by the same family. Its very friendly owner, Ioannis Gerakis, came from a family of peasants and in 1965 began to buy fruit and vegetables from local farmers, some of whom were producing organic produce, and he also began serving traditional dishes. Ioannis Gerakis' visionary approach paid off, as his tavern is now one of the best in Heraklion.
The Cretan diet is known for its very low-fat content and its high level of vegetable consumption, as well as for its simplicity and high nutritional value. Olive oil is the main ingredient, and people have been living and eating on it for more than 5,000 years, ever since the Minoan civilization. Wild greens, soumegiounes, made with spinach, kardomata, made with purslane, and kithyropita, a dish made with pumpkin or artichokes, all make up part of the Cretan diet and are a trademark of the cuisine.
In addition, food has traditionally been kept in a natural way, rather than being made or preserved with chemicals and preservatives. This is why food cooked in traditional Cretan households usually contains very few ingredients and does not require sauces. Fresh vegetables, bread, salt, oil and cheese, and sometimes meat, seafood or fish, are the main ingredients of the traditional cuisine. These recipes have been passed down through generations and continue to play an important part in the diet of many Cretans today.
Another main characteristic of the Cretan diet is that it focuses on whole products that are fresh and free from preservatives, and encourages the use of ingredients from organic farms. Olive oil, herbs and many other ingredients are used to flavour dishes and enhance their nutritional value, contributing to the vitality of the Cretan people, and according to many studies, maintaining the longevity of the people of the island. Herbs, olives,

For centuries it’s been watching from below, observing and listening.
In the clear, turquoise lake, a girl sits beside the water and gives her heart to the sea.
Over the years she’s grown and changed; the girl becomes a woman.
Always returning to the lake, she spends each summer at the bottom of the deep.
But life is not always safe from the Monster below.
Sometimes things lurk below the surface.
The Monster begins to reach out to her, whispering lies into her ears.
It is an old trick.
To get into the minds of those who enter the water, causing them to do things they would never do.
Never let them out of your sight.
But she does, and the monster reaches into her mind and changes her.
No matter how hard she tries, she cannot let go of the grip the monster has on her.
She fights it as much as she can.
She tries to beat it back with her spirit.
It’s an old fight, an eternal fight.
The water of the sea reaches towards the monster.
It encircles the monster and attempts to drown it.
It pushes on the monster and tries to submerge it.
But the monster fights back, it reaches into the depths and takes the woman’s life.
The sea rages, but the monster does not budge.
It is invincible, with its tentacles reaching into the depths.
It snatches the body of the woman and brings her to the bottom of the abyss, before holding her tight in its clutches.
The waves begin to move, pulling the waters up and into the sky.
Towards the shore the waters rage, dragging the body of the woman along.
The lightning flashes across the sky and thunder booms down, echoing off the mountains.
With her one remaining arm, the monster reaches towards the woman and pulls her deeper.
There, at the bottom of the abyss, the monster’s tents cover her completely.
The monster laughs as the people look on in terror.
The monster, for that is what it is, laughs as it enjoys the disharmony it creates in the world.
The monster sees the sadness of humanity, the anger and fear.
The monster watches the world through the crack in its hide.
The monster does not know if it will ever leave the depths of the abyss.
But it plans to remain.
It will be forever.
Voices of a few remaining lights of humanity ring through its ears.
The distant shouts of the voices bring the monster back to its senses.
Voices from those who have been harmed by its actions.
As one, the world decides to fight.
With its few, remaining fighters it is able to control the monster.
The monster listens to its final orders.
For a moment the water recedes, the wave of seismic power that rocked the land calms down.
The lightning stops and thunder rumbles to a gentle mutter.
It has all stopped.
The light of humanity no longer shines.
The voice of the people is no more.
No more voices of those fighting back.
These few lights are not enough to douse the darkness.
With the shadows covering the remaining light, the sun no longer shines, no longer moves.
The stars no longer shine.
Only the darkness remains.
The monster watches on, with the stars covering its face.
The moon shines down on the lake, which has been tranquil since the passing of the waters.
The girl, who is now the monster’s prisoner, floats beneath the surface of the water.
The monster remains there in the abyss with her, waiting.
It doesn’t know what will happen next, but it is prepared to fight.
The girl fights back, her last thoughts are for the lost souls.
As the waters pull her to the bottom of the lake, her thoughts turn towards them.
These lost souls, these people who used to be so similar.
They thought that they were fighting for something so beautiful, something so good.
But now they are lost.
They have been devoured by the darkness, now they are trapped by it.
These people were once with her, once with the monster.
But she knows what she must do.

In my parents’ bathroom, I stepped into the bathtub and closed the lid. At the other end of the counter, a trash can sat against the wall.
From the trash can, I pulled out a hunk of canvas. Then, I stepped out of the bathtub and to the other side of the toilet. I pulled on the canvas.
Suddenly, there was no fan noise or hammering from the roof. There was no hissing from the freezer. There was only silence.
I took a deep breath, shaking off the outside chaos.
For the next 10 minutes, I stared at my phone’s screen as I watched and waited. Gradually, the fan started up again.
My family hadn’t been hurt. We had survived the storm.
The next day, we realized that we had been lucky to have been able to remove our belongings to the ground floor of our home before the flooding started.
Without our insurance and furniture, we were left without a kitchen table, a dining room table, a couch, or a single chair.
We had lost many things, but our most precious possession remained.
My family survived because of our supportive community. We had clean clothes and food because of our neighbors’ generosity and love.
A month later, things were no longer the same. Our neighborhood streets were completely blocked off. School and work had been closed for over a month.
The turmoil had come at the beginning of the school year, and it seemed that time stood still.
While I enjoyed my fresh start, my new classes made the other kids cry. Many other students returned from the flood.
Some of their houses were still unreachable. Others hadn’t found a place to live yet.
Although the turmoil had halted life for a while, the weather started to get better. After the hurricane, we tried to return to normal life.
It was summer, so I began thinking about my plans. At the beginning of the summer, I had only one goal: to live a life away from my family and my neighbors.
I wanted to do something new, and I wanted to travel.
However, after the storm, my priorities changed.
I felt an intense need to do something to help.
I searched for volunteer opportunities and quickly realized that I couldn’t just decide to help.
There was a large need for volunteers, but the effort wasn’t on the same level as the community’s own efforts.
Everybody was working. Everybody was doing something. Everybody was donating what they could.
I didn’t want to leave my community alone when it needed support the most.
During the school year, I looked for volunteer opportunities.
There weren’t any, so I decided to make my own.
I applied to volunteer at local camps and at my old primary school. My mother’s friend, who was the principal of the school, helped me and provided me with free parking.
I spent my summer planning activities for the kids.
I created a marketing plan for the camps, and I communicated with the staff about everything.
Sometimes, I talked to parents on the phone and sent them emails to remind them of the activities for the day.
I planned activities for the kids, so they could enjoy their summer.
I wanted them to be active, but I also wanted them to have fun.
Many kids didn’t have a lot of time at home, and many of them had to finish their homework and take care of their siblings at home.
The camps allowed them to relax a little and focus on their schoolwork.
The kids were motivated to do their schoolwork in order to enjoy the next day’s activities, which ranged from biking to swimming.
My favorite part of the summer was being outside with the kids.
Many of the kids told me about their storm experience. Some of them were still worried about their missing animals.
I told them how I felt and what I was worried about. I wanted them to know that I was there for them.
At the end of the summer, I received an offer to work as an intern for the hurricane’s recovery.
The internship lasted six months.
I was promoted to manager of the marketing team. I coordinated the dissemination of materials to people in need, planned fundraising events, and developed content for the organization’s website and social media pages.
During that time, I decided

Where to Read This Featured New Release
Title: Woodcraft
Format: E-Book, Audiobook, Paperback
Woodcraft is one of the first LGBTQ fantasy novels I’ve read and enjoyed, and it quickly became one of my favorites.
If I have to say anything about this book, it’s that the characters are amazing. The character development and growth is there. And every single one of them is unique and has a place in this story. Every single one is truly important and will have a major impact on Eve’s journey, and there’s a little bit of every character archetype in there. And, like a real fairytale, Woodcraft’s characters act as much like messengers as characters. There are many well-worn fairytale tropes in Woodcraft, and it took me back to the fairytales I used to read as a child.
The world-building is also stunning. Everything from how the kingdom of the Witch-Empress came to be to the geography, history, and myths is absolutely fascinating. The magic system is also wonderful; Eve herself explains it at the beginning of the book. This is also another story that has a lot of wisdom and knowledge woven into the story, and I loved it. The religion and magic of the world are complex and fascinating, and they also present a lot of the questions I’ve always had about fairy tales and why they work.
If I had to say something negative about this book, it would be that, by the end, the climax was rather rushed. Everything was building up to the climax, but it was only about 40 pages long, and I felt that it could have been longer and handled better. But, as far as the story goes, it was still wrapped up very nicely, and it’s definitely one of my favorites.
Recommendation: Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes. This is one of the best LGBTQ fantasy novels I’ve ever read, and it’s one of my favorite novels of all time.
Four and a half out of five stars for this one. I cannot recommend it enough.
Content Warning: This novel has some intense, graphic scenes of animal murder, war, and blood.
Also, the majority of the characters are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or aromantic and asexual, and there’s a strong focus on aromantic and asexual rep. There’s also a lot of myths and religion based on the worship of Mother Nature.

Thank you for reading this! I’m really glad that you liked this one. It really is a masterpiece and will always hold a special place in my heart. I was really disappointed with the climax as well, but I like how it was still so concise and elegant that it didn’t really take

2024-09-25 03:19:42,003 - Prompt 40: The decision to embark on a solo travel adventure leads to life-changing experiences in
2024-09-25 03:19:42,003 - Generated text:  many ways.
If you’re not used to traveling alone, then doing it can be a big deal. Here are some reasons why it may be worth it to go solo.
Traveling alone doesn’t have to be difficult. Many solo travelers will book accommodations with rooms for just one person in mind. You won’t have to pay for a second bed or worry about roommates’ shenanigans late into the night.
There are many positive aspects of solo travel, one of which is being able to discover the local culture of a city.
Solo travel is a way of seeing the world that can offer unparalleled opportunities to connect with people and explore new places.
3. You have to rely on yourself.
When traveling alone, you must rely on yourself for everything. You will always have to make decisions for yourself, whether it’s deciding where to eat or what to do with your time. Solo travel is not for the faint of heart! It requires courage, self-confidence, and independence.
4. You meet the locals.
When you travel solo, you get to meet the locals. They’re more likely to invite you to join in on activities or share their stories.
You get to discover the real side of a place without having to filter your experiences through someone else’s eyes.
You can explore the world without worrying about the safety of others. When you travel alone, you can go where you want, when you want. You don’t have to worry about a group schedule or pleasing other people.
6. You find out who you are.
Solo travel allows us to discover who we are and what we like without distraction from friends or family members. It gives us time alone to reflect on our lives and our goals. It also provides an opportunity for self-discovery and introspection, which can be beneficial in helping us figure out what we want from life.
7. You learn to appreciate the small things.
Solo travel can teach you to appreciate the small things in life. When you’re traveling alone, it’s easier to notice your surroundings and appreciate them. You may even find that you have a new appreciation for the little things back home.
8. You learn to be self-sufficient.
When you travel alone, you learn to be self-sufficient. This means that you have to take care of yourself and make your own decisions. It can be a bit intimidating at first, but it’s also very empowering. You’ll feel more confident in your abilities and know that you can handle anything that comes your way.
9. You appreciate your home more.
When you return from traveling, you’ll appreciate your home and life more than ever before. You’ll have a new perspective on everything. Traveling allows us to see the world and experience new things. This new perspective will help us be more thankful for the things we have at home.
10. You learn to live on a budget.
Traveling can be expensive. When you travel alone, you have to make the most of your money and figure out how to live on a budget. This can be a difficult experience, but it will help you learn how to live more frugally when you return home.
11. You make memories.
When you travel alone, you’re forced to make memories by yourself. This can be both a good and bad thing. You’ll have a lot of memories from your travels, but you may also find yourself missing having someone to share the experience with.
12. You find yourself.
Traveling alone gives you the opportunity to find yourself. You’ll have time to reflect on your life and who you are as a person. You may also discover new things about yourself that you never knew before.
13. You become more resilient.
When you travel alone, you learn how to be resilient. This is because you’re often on your own and have to figure things out on your own. You’ll become more resourceful and able to handle any situation that comes your way.
14. You make new friends.
Traveling alone can be lonely at times, but you’ll also meet many new people along the way. You’ll make friends from all over the world and have some incredible experiences with them. These friendships can last a lifetime.
15. You see the world differently.
When you travel alone, you’ll see the world differently than you ever have before. You’ll have a new perspective on everything and a greater appreciation for the little things in life.
16. You gain confidence.
Traveling solo can be intimidating

Rising from their cots, they continued their ritual of placing morsels of dry bread in their children's hands, giving them one last nudge to get dressed, then watching them run into the street, shouting excitedly about the day's events. The morning sun cut through the windows and heated the room like the smoldering fire in their bellies.
"I could use a morsel of dry bread myself," Benjamin said.
"Yes, and you could use a strong cup of coffee to go with it."
"I wouldn't mind." Benjamin nodded toward the baby. "When will Dov liven up and start cooing like that fellow on the sidewalk?"
Naomi had heard the faint sounds of a baby crying from their neighbors' apartment. She'd marveled at it several times since moving into their quarters. "He's just like their children, I suppose. He'll make a little sound now and then."
She started toward the kitchen to find something to eat.
"Naomi, wait!"
She turned. Benjamin was gazing at her with a dreamy look in his eyes. "What is it, darling?"
"I've never asked you this, have I?"
"Asked what?" She sat down on a stool next to the stove, not sure what he was getting at.
"Have you ever wondered if our children . . ."
"Yes, I've wondered. About your children, I mean. I know about your family. My children are . . ."
"I didn't mean your children. I meant the children we would have together. Have you ever wondered about them?"
"Not so much. It would be . . . wonderful to have a little girl of our own, I suppose." She shook her head. "I can't see me settling down and having children, though. I still don't feel right about it. I don't know . . . I might feel differently in a few more years."
"I'd love you either way. I suppose the children we would have would be so dark . . ."
"I was thinking the same thing. I've wondered how you'd react."
He didn't answer. His expression gave her the answer.
"How would we explain it to them? Would we lie and say that they were 'colored'? Or would we tell them they're just 'from poor families'?"
He pulled her down on his lap. "I would tell them, without fear, that their mother is beautiful. She's an attractive dark-skinned woman. She's an attractive woman no matter what the color of her skin is. And I would tell our children what you just told me. Our children will be beautiful. They'll be extraordinary. But they'll still be our children."
Naomi nodded. "You're right, you know. If God wants us to have a family, it would be a little ridiculous to wait. We should find out now."
The twins returned with a clatter, their cries and excited shouts filling the room.
"We're going to the market today. Want to come with us?"
"Sure, Naomi." Benjamin held his son up by the waist. "You, too, Dov. My, you've grown since I last saw you."
"But what about the clothing?" Naomi asked, nudging the twins toward the door. "It's almost time for school. You need your books and your hats."
"I'll tell Mrs. Grossman. Maybe we can wait until after classes," Ben said. "There are things I need to do today anyway. We can still get home in time for dinner."
"As you wish," Naomi said. "That will be a help."
Dov skipped across the room. "Are you going to buy some candy for me?"
"Yes, but only a little."
"And for me?"
"And for you, too."
The twins followed their mother through the door and down the hallway. They disappeared into the kitchen, where the others were drinking coffee and eating toast. Naomi closed the door behind her.
"Are you okay?" Jesse asked.
"Just tired. It's been a long week. Do you think you and Ben could get Dov ready this morning, for me?"
The twins nodded eagerly. "Yeah, we can do it. We'll get him all ready."

Pirates Of Suburbia: The Adventures of Captain Silver
My Dog Skip (Widescreen)
Heavy-handed but funny dog tale.
Parents need to know that Super Buddies is a 2012 family movie about a dog who believes he's a superhero and starts a rescue squad to save the neighborhood. That means there's lots of excitement, action, and, yes, peril -- but there's no bloodshed. A few characters are bullies, including The Butcher, a thuggish human who has a hammer as his weapon of choice, but the movie doesn't glorify or gloss over the dangers of vigilantism. Instead, it addresses moral issues and shows characters at odds about whether the neighborhood is truly safe, and it points to the value of positive peer pressure. This movie can appeal to animal lovers who also enjoy watching humans interact with their canine pals. There's no strong language or sexuality, but there are a few jokes that involve casual sex. Adults may recognize Jeff Foxworthy and Joel McHale in speaking roles.

Are social robots desirable?
Given that nearly every single story in the press today covers a new type of social robot (along with new problems with robotics), you could be forgiven for thinking that all of these conversational agents are desirable. Is this true though? Is it desirable for a robot to know us intimately, perhaps even have more information about our lives than we do? Will it mean that robots that are better, perhaps even too good, at understanding us become dominant in our lives? If these things are desirable, how can they be made so?
Friday POPO - Does machine learning create new problems for our society?
Each Friday we will share a quick and recent thought about a work in progress from our team.
There is currently a strong research community around conversational agents and social robots. The technology is progressing very fast and several companies are already using and selling this technology. This raises the question of how it impacts society and culture. To start with we discuss the impact that the evolving conversational agent technology has on human-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication and interaction. One topic which is relevant to this discussion is privacy and user interface design. Next we focus on the more long term impact that the technology has on society. This includes the technological and ethical issues raised by self-driving cars, how AI technology influences human decision-making, the impact of learning with a conversational agent, and its impact on cultural norms and evolution.
These videos are taken from the POPO wiki.
This is the second of our scheduled monthly meetings. Join us in person for presentations from Rob Shield, Rob Riggio and Nathaniel Taylor, with a panel Q&A to follow.
Hosted by Nathaniel Taylor (Senior Lecturer in Sociology, Loughborough University).
The TALE project is funded by the European Research Council, starting in April 2015. It is a collaborative research project led by Professor Jos van Erp of the Department of Sociology of Media and Communication at the University of Groningen (NL), where it will be hosted for a period of 5 years.
This project uses social robotics, social psychology and science and technology studies to develop an understanding of how new technologies such as robot companions, autonomous vehicles and bio-digital prostheses can impact on people's lives and behaviours in society.
RoboChallenge is a long-running annual competition for state of the art robots, including social robots, on the challenge of robots partnering with people. It has a multitude of challenges including one based on a football/soccer game, to which robots play against one another with a person in control. It will be held at the NAO open house at the end of June.
RoboChallenge will open their 2015 football challenges to developers and researchers worldwide, allowing individuals and teams to create their own football robots that can compete against their peers on the competition. Developers and teams can take part by building their own robots that will be able to play the football challenges in 2015.
It will consist of four competitions (amateur, open, semifinal and final).
Open online/offline competition. 10 April 2015.
Applications must be sent to robotchallenge@leapspattern.com by 23:59 CEST 10 April. The documents must be in English.
30 shortlisted teams will be contacted on 15 April with the instructions for the delivery of the robots to the venue and with the dates and times of the competition.
The final event will be held on 25 June 2015.
Teams must comply with the rules and regulations of the competition.
Any abuse or deviation from these rules will result in disqualification of the participating team.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,004 - Prompt 49: A mysterious artifact uncovered in Egypt revealed
2024-09-25 03:19:42,004 - Generated text:  clues to 4000 year old cosmic events.
When we think of Egypt, we often imagine the ancient pyramids, temples, mummies and hieroglyphs, but a recent discovery from the dry, dusty land of Egypt is not of the ancient past, but has a more surprising connection to the future.
Last December, a team of scientists and astronomers uncovered a natural monument that appears to have been constructed to mark the timing of an extremely rare celestial event that only occurs once every 2,500 years. The curious structure was discovered in the middle of a now-deserted valley in southern Egypt.
At the center of the massive circle is a large stone that once formed a perfect circle with 12 smaller stones, each aligned with the constellation Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters. The remarkable structure was uncovered on the slopes of a steep-sided valley near Cairo, in the middle of Egypt’s Western Desert. The team says that it must have once formed part of a sacred site.
According to the team that uncovered the remains of this unusual temple, the number 12 represented the number of months in a year, while the number 25 meant a period of 2500 years (32 times the number of months in 12 years).
Astronomical structures seem to be scattered across the globe in ancient sites. In May 2013, a stone circle of 21 large stones was discovered at Sweet Track in Glastonbury, England, to be a sun temple. Archaeologists and astronomers believe the circle was positioned to follow the sun throughout the year.
According to Richard Freund, the University of Hartford archaeologist leading the excavations, the Egyptian researchers only had fragments of information to follow, but still discovered a large structure that seemed to be related to a solar eclipse.
It is believed that the alignment of the stones with the constellation Pleiades was intended to predict the duration and timing of the rising of a bright star named Giza that would follow a particular cycle of events.
Eclipses were incredibly important to ancient civilizations, and one of the most feared of these events was the eclipse that blocked the sun for several minutes and announced the start of the reign of a new pharaoh.
This was described in a sacred text from the Old Kingdom of Egypt, a book called The First to be Reborn in the West, written during the reign of King Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled Egypt around 2200 BCE.
When this important time came, an enormous concourse of priests would head to the Giza temple of the Aten and gather for six nights to pray for protection from the devastating effects of the eclipse.
The following morning, the priests would light a huge torch and head to the tallest peak of Mt. Hatshepsut to the north of the temple. There, they would light another massive torch and wait for the sun to block out the bright star, which would have been visible on the horizon.
The last remaining witnesses to the new pharaoh’s reign would then sing and dance their way back to Giza, where they were welcomed by the joyous revelry of those who were lucky enough to be born under this new pharaoh.
Over the centuries, these rituals would help to ensure that the pharaohs remained in power, since they would only be allowed to rule Egypt until their next birthday.
The researchers have also discovered fragments of a limestone statue, which appears to be very ancient. Researchers hope to find out more about the strange statuette when they begin working on the site during the 2014 season.
The team was made up of a group of researchers from France and Egypt, and discovered the ancient site during a mission called The Sphinx Dream Team.
“These kinds of celestial observations are crucial in order to better understand the origins of ancient cultures,” said Dominique Kratz, an astrophysicist who was also part of the research team.
“We do not know the exact purpose of the construction, and are still studying its location in the context of Egyptian culture,” Freund said.
The Egyptian team expressed great interest in learning more about the culture of the people who inhabited the region centuries before the emergence of Egypt. A group of young Egyptian archaeologists joined the team during the 2013 season to learn about new and modern methods of archaeological research.
The work in the site is ongoing, and we will be sure to report any new information on this intrigu

With shul letters in hand, the children climbed up in bed and, through their laughter, excitement, and sometime tears, eventually fell asleep. But what could these seemingly unrelated elements have in common? They were all part of the 3rd annual Tot Shabbat campfire session in Camp Machaneh Hadassah, a girls-only camp.
Throughout the summer, the camp’s daily and Shabbat activities are infused with Jewish culture and values to instill a strong Jewish identity in its campers. The rabbis of Camp Hillel, which holds the only three-day overnight camp for Jewish teens in the United States, as well as its campers, are a prime example of campers living a fully immersed Jewish life.
From their very first days in camp, campers are immersed in traditional and contemporary Jewish culture.
The week’s weekly Parsha Talk, in which campers join their bunks in the great hall to hear a talk from the rabbis on that week’s Parsha, is a signature Hillel program. Hillel’s eight week-long theme camps include Torah, the Bible, Holocaust, Jewish-American culture, and Israel, as well as Jewish-American and Israeli summer camp. Each camp is run by a rabbi who shares the week’s theme through programs, Shabbatons, and activities.
The Zalman Shiffman Foundation, which supports the Camp Hillel Project, recognizes that fostering a love of Jewish values, community and learning is crucial to Jewish continuity. It also realizes that the best way to do so is through hands-on experiences. The Foundation believes that Camp Hillel, through its overnight camping experience, can make a difference in a Jewish child’s life and identity.
Girls and boys, campers and staff alike, leave camp with memories that will last a lifetime and that will make Jewish learning and practice meaningful and relevant to them. Through the Foundation’s assistance, campers are free from the responsibility of paying, leaving them to focus on enriching their Jewish experience and personal growth.
And enriched Jewish experiences are the main goal of campers and staff. After all, Camp Hillel is not your average overnight camp. It combines religious education, outdoor activities, sports, and experiential Jewish education with the fun and excitement of an overnight camp. This is why when entering Camp Hillel’s grounds you see a magnificent Orthodox shul, Kabbalat Shabbat and Havdalah on Friday evening, and Mincha and Maariv each afternoon. It is also why you can often find Shabbat meals being shared by the entire camp. There is also a distinctive cheder-like environment that will not only enrich your child’s Jewish knowledge but also will give her and you the gift of a lifetime.
Hillel campers will learn how to daven, count the blessings, celebrate holidays, and participate in kiddushim, as well as study the Tanach, parshiyos, and holidays through the weekly Shabbatons. And after experiencing the richness and joy of Shabbos and Jewish tradition, your child will know why learning Torah is so relevant.
Living and experiencing the Torah in camp is like a breath of fresh air; it is educational, fun, and gives one a deep sense of awe and gratitude towards God. Not only will the Foundation help you find the right camp for your child to live a Torah-observant life, it will also help her create a wonderful lifelong memories and passions towards Torah and Judaism.
The Foundation encourages your child to enjoy her summer of learning, growing, and creating friendships with other Jewish children.
Your child will receive an education through which she will come to fully appreciate the beauty of Jewish culture and tradition, as well as gain a deeper and more enriched experience of Torah.
Your child will receive quality Jewish education at an Orthodox Jewish Camp that will last a lifetime.
The Zalman Shiffman Foundation helps you afford sending your child to a camp that provides the best Jewish education, facilities, programs, and activities for your child to enjoy, grow, and be inspired.
From mid-May to late August, the camp facilities are bursting with excitement. Children will take part in new experiences, make new friends, laugh, play, and learn. You’ll have peace of mind knowing that your child is safe, learning, and having fun in a quality Jewish environment.

How do we describe the Almighty's character? I believe that only God Himself can give us the real and full picture of God.
Creation reveals that God is not harsh and unforgiving. God is full of mercy and compassion. He has a loving heart that desires to be near us.
God is known in the Old Testament as the Lord of Love. He loves you!
I do not love you because I see your beauty.
I see you and I love you.
(God's love for us is unlike any other love that we could ever experience.)
But if we love God, we should love one another also.
The love of God is revealed through the cross.
If we allow God to do a work in our hearts, we can begin to live as the Lord of Love intended for us.
There are those who say that God does not have a loving heart, or is cold and indifferent. They do not understand that the Lord's love is personal and gracious.
This is not the love of a mushy and romantic partner. It is the love that embraces you as the most valuable treasure, including the possibility of trusting your heart to God.
It is the kind of love that shows you just how precious you are. It is a love that does not end.
Look what happens when someone is committed to God and His Word.
The life we live is fully embraced by the grace of God.
It is an experience of being known by God, the Lord of Love.
If we invite the Lord of Love into our hearts, our lives will never be the same.
Spend some time with God today and begin to share your heart with Him.
He longs to be with you and is willing to do whatever it takes to get your attention.
We all have needs.
We have a need to love and be loved.
The need to express our creativity.
We have a need to accomplish our purpose.
We all long for purpose, an identity, belonging and love.
We have a need for guidance and a compass to navigate life's journey.
We need to know that our lives are significant and that we matter.
All of these needs and desires have a common thread...to find true peace in the face of what life brings.
These needs are satisfied by the Lord of Love.
"You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
These laws were given by Moses to define the Israelite nation's love for God and love for each other.
They were designed to be a holy nation that could stand out from all other nations.
These statutes were intended to help people reach a new level of righteousness.
But we cannot love our neighbors unless we first love God.
"But I say to you that love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven."
There is more to being a son of God than simply believing in Him.
When we come to faith in Christ, we receive a new life, a new nature.
God will help us love others.
We all have enemies in this world.
What are some of the ways that God's love has helped you to deal with the enemy?
What does it mean to really hate evil, and to really love righteousness?
I've come to realize that if I really loved God with all my heart and soul, I would have a heart to hate evil and do everything I could to live a righteous life.
When we truly love the Lord, we have the strength to overcome evil and temptation.
The Lord's love can transform a life from dark and sinful to light and pure.
God's love for us is greater than our sin, our weakness, our failure, our heartache and all of our enemies.
Because of our faith in Jesus Christ, the Lord's love enables us to say, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
This is a love that enables us to love one another.
We do not have to deal with hate, envy, anger, or lust.
These are all a result of the love of self, not the Lord of Love.
When the Lord's love is first in our lives, we are able to love one another.
"God, the source of love, shows that He loves us. The only thing He did was to die for us."

It is 100 degrees, the sky is white, the air is clear, there is no wind, and the air smells of creosote and algae. The immigration shelter is a stop before midnight, when the bus will deposit the asylum seekers in Joplin.
The migrants rest on a river rock road and ponder what lies ahead: the shadow of McAlester, the shadow of Edmond, the shadow of Norman. At every sign, they consider whether to stay in Joplin, whether to push on to Chicago. They recount stories about why they left, what they expect from the American Dream, how they'll pay for school, how they'll fill a room, the pain of their separation from loved ones.
There is a debate about whether to keep their phones with a hotspot or whether to stick them in their pockets. Most seem to keep them nearby. They post photos of themselves online and Google search when they can. There are those who have the Internet on their phones and those who can't.
The journey has just begun.
About half of the men are from Central American countries: Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Another quarter come from African countries, some of them are from Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Togo and the Ivory Coast. A few are from Iran.
In their backpacks, the travelers carry ties, shorts, a few shirts and their eagerness to start work. Some have slipped on T-shirts, while others strap on sneakers. A few are holding an ablution kit.
Some have had a chance to bathe and brush their teeth. They're using wet wipes to clean the chalk dust off their pants, but they don't care to complain. Their rucksacks are too heavy. Their shoulders are cramping. Their feet are sore. They don't feel like talking. They just want to get where they are going.
They will pass the time on this bus trip by reading books and magazines, they'll stare out the window and they will stop by small towns and drink coffee. Some don't know when they will have a meal.
Here is where they arrived the night before: Las Vegas, New Mexico. It is 11 p.m.
They got off the bus around 1 a.m. in this town of about 12,000. After being fingerprinted and interrogated, they were told the 31-year-old humanitarian crisis on the Mexican border had slowed and they would have to wait a week before their asylum hearings.
Had they been planning to detain the migrants and send them back to El Paso?
Their bus was parked on an empty lot where apartment buildings were under construction and where police cars and a handful of migrants were huddled. The group seemed to be waiting for the bus to move, though the bus driver and staff didn't seem sure what to do.
Soon, an immigration official climbed onto the bus and told them they would have to stay until the next morning at the most. They would be put up at an immigration shelter in Joplin, 60 miles north, and they'd be taken to it by bus the next day. The only sign of worry was an intake of breath from the migrants.
At the shelter, they slept on cots and ate hot meals. They washed their clothes and filled out papers to work for Social Security, and they wondered about the McDonald's sauce they found on their toothbrushes.
The men describe the bus trip in grunts. They talk about the red soda and the girl with the outstretched hands who told them they needed to buy toilet paper. They don't complain.
One man speaks English. He says it is slow. He says they need to hurry up. He was from Togo. He was looking for a better life. He had a girlfriend. He was headed to Chicago.
Some of them have jobs. Some of them don't. They come from all over. They've been here six years. They've been here six months. They've been here 10 months. They've been here 25 years.
The next morning, they will be given options: Call a friend in the U.S. to pick you up. Go on a bus to Chicago.

However, as can be observed on the interactive map, in the attic they appear to have chosen to forge swords rather than a wrench.
That the castle's residents built the passages for the express purpose of forging weapons of mass destruction was confirmed by eyewitnesses as well as both video footage and various manuals.
Yet their choice of tool inevitably raises questions.
Anxiety over the increasingly militarized nature of Utopia's government has been steadily mounting since Huxley first suggested that some citizens may be forced to bear arms.
What if, as other residents point out, the residents on top of the attic lacked the proper skills to carry out their intended task?
To this problem, those on top of the attic have apparently responded by locking the castle's residents in the basement.
Clearly, one or more residents were concerned that the conflict between the martial and the refinements of court life was eroding any spirit of brotherhood.
According to onlookers, one of the men approached the blade workers, in what appeared to be an effort to dissuade them from forging. The men then threatened to retaliate by sending their forges into the water.
Within hours, military blockades cut off the castle's main supply lines.
At the time, the other members of the castle's inhabitants were not considered essential workers and thus were evacuated to Mordor, along with the rest of the planet's non-essential personnel.
In the ensuing chaos, others attempted to carry out their own forging.
Some accused the men of forging swords specifically so they could take them and leave.
While such unscrupulous behavior has led to numerous investigations and inquiries, the government's primary response has been to bar those who witnessed the alleged offenses from the castle.
Nevertheless, other forms of recreation continue in the castle, in an effort to distract residents from uncomfortable truths.
However, the suspicious nature of the remaining residents has raised questions about their innocence.
Despite its power, the castle's automated air quality control system is only as good as the equipment installed in the castle.
That, along with the onset of winter, have combined to create a nearly unbearable state of affairs.
According to one resident, the offending odor appears to be related to a failure of the furnace.
As the smell continues to grow more pungent, residents fear that it may ultimately cause the castle's collapse.
Many hope that a breeze from the surrounding forest will provide enough air to last until the following morning, when the resident in charge of facilities should arrive.
Because of his position of responsibility, it has been suggested that he will inevitably be blamed for any loss of life or property caused by the odor.
Since it is clear that Huxley is responsible for all, including the failure of the furnace, we can safely assume that the present official in charge of facilities is fully aware of all facts.
If he is so aware, why does he appear to be trying to hide the issue from residents of the castle?
Given the perpetual popularity of 3D sculpture among its residents, it is particularly telling that those in the castle appear to ignore sculptures in favor of less tangible forms of entertainment.
And while the castle features an enviable collection of paintings, we can understand why the residents of the castle appear disinterested in them, since they are not rendered in the style of the time, which might be considered anachronistic.
It is particularly curious that there is a great deal of interest in musical entertainment, despite the limited facilities available for rehearsal.
Music may also offer a source of creative solace, given the recent difficulties residents of the castle have had.
It is for this reason that we would like to remind residents of the castle of the Huxley Code.
And in that same spirit, it is important to note that Mr. Huxley has told us nothing about the events that transpired in the castle during the preceding days.
He has also offered no comment on the men's decision to use weapons to accomplish the task for which they were hired.
This attitude stands in stark contrast to Mr. Huxley's public statements about the ethics of military engagement.
What's more, Mr. Huxley is hardly unique in his support for war, since every resident of the castle has signed at least one, if not more, non-ag

The performance of the Lantern Dance is conducted in a way that no martial artist will ever forget it. The lights illuminate the scene, and the bright, sparkling firecrackers burst in the air. The drums reverberate with each dance movement. When the dancers gather at the center, hundreds of drums echo in the sky. When the dance is over, all of the drummers put their sticks on the ground and their arms on each other’s shoulders, in a ring formation, chanting loudly. In the end, the whole drum formation bursts into tears. It is said that those who burst into tears have missed their homes.
I remember a scene from my childhood: one day when my parents were coming back from the firecrackers store, I asked my mother to play with me. She did not want to play, and said she had to go back to the store. I followed her, running and running until I finally caught up with her. I held her hand and whispered, “You have to play with me, mother.”
On the spot, I broke into tears.
Because of my tears, my mother broke into tears, and so did I. The mother returned to the store, and I ran home with my heart full of joy.
Every time I go to the scene of this memory, I cannot help weeping.
Fragments of the Lantern Dance are performed around the world. If you have the opportunity to watch them, do not miss it. It will change your life.

I had the idea of being able to communicate with someone without talking to them. The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. I spent all my time thinking about it. I even went to a watch repair shop to have my watch band lengthened so I could wear my watch around my wrist and use my other hand to work with my electrical tools. I was on a hunt. I became a fanatical trapper.
_Thomas Edison: A Biography_ , by Paul Israel
TELEGRAPHY FOR ELECTRIC WAGONS
While he was at West Orange, N.J., Thomas Edison also experimented with telephony—or the transmission of speech over electrical wires. He had obtained from Charles Batchelor an 1876 book by Scottish scientist Alexander Graham Bell, who had filed for a patent a few months before the book came out. In the book, Bell detailed his invention of the telephone, which he called a "practical method of sending speech in the telegraph mode by electricity." In the inventor's mind, the telephone could help the railroads communicate with one another, as well as with passengers, and the inventor believed that "the supreme utility of a telephone to the electric telegraph industry" was that "it was cheap and easy to install, could run on the telegraph system, and was particularly suited to railroads." But in the mid-1870s, Bell wasn't focused on anything but the telephone; Edison was the first to build the electric telegraph with a telephone at its end.
In 1877, Edison also took out his first patent for a way to send sound from a source into a telephone, through a wire, and then over a telegraph circuit. The electric signal would pass through the wire, be transformed by a relay, and then pass through a telephone to the person on the other end of the wire. For this system to work, a source had to be directly connected to the telegraph line; there had to be an operator who would telegraph information received over the line back to the source; and the telephone and telegraph had to operate on different frequencies. Bell had patented such a system in 1876.
While working on the telegraph at West Orange, Edison also built a device that had a knife switch, or a double-acting switch, that allowed it to "connect or disconnect simultaneously an electric circuit and a sound circuit at any point in these circuits." When Bell's patent on the telephone came to an end in 1894, Edison made a last-ditch attempt to obtain a patent for his earlier version. But the company that held the patent for his device, the United States Electrical Vehicle Company, had already sold it, and the patent right went to the buyer, a company in Pennsylvania. When the deal fell through, Edison realized he would have to modify his 1877 patent, which he did in 1896, but it was too late. He had lost.
In the meantime, Edison's invention of the telephone was too far ahead of its time. In 1878, the U.S. Army was testing a device that could carry "electro-magnetic and other impulses," and in 1879 Edison decided to build a complete system to make sure that telephone messages could be transmitted over long distances. The United States Electrical Vehicle Company manufactured one thousand miles of telephone wire and installed it on the rails of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in December 1879, Edison made his first telephone call. It went from the railroad telegraph station in Philadelphia to Edison's office in West Orange. Then he made another telephone call, this one from New York to Philadelphia. The experiment went so well that in 1880 the Western Union Telegraph Company ordered eight thousand miles of telephone wire.
FIRST TELEPHONE CALL
Thomas Edison
December 10, 1879
Charles Batchelor was in Philadelphia, working at the Pennsylvania Railroad's telegraph office, and he received a phone call.
"This is Thomas A. Edison speaking," Edison said.
The first message of what came to be known as Edison's telephone experiment was transmitted on December 10, 1879, by way of a telephone. Edison spoke with a voice from a telephone located in Philadelphia to a "speaking telephone" connected with the railroad telegraph office in

2024-09-25 03:19:42,005 - Generated text:  a global chain of events that threatens to spark war between humanity and the wrathful beings that live in the Earth's mantle. To protect humanity, ex-Marine and ex-sergeant in the Army Nora Wheeler must defeat the rogue gnome that caused the problem.
This is book 2 in The Coffee Gnome Chronicles, a fast-paced urban fantasy action-adventure that features an ex-Marine turned ex-soldier who is up against the odds with gnomes at every turn. There's mystery, magic, intrigue, and romance, but also funny social commentary on politics, morality, corporate culture, technology, and more.
The Coffee Gnome Chronicles is highly recommended reading for fans of Jim Butcher, Diana Wynne Jones, Charlie Daniels, Jim Fusilli, or fans of the paranormal.
From day one as an indie author, I've been drawn to the amazing Coffee Gnome Chronicles series by Janine K. Spendlove.
Ms. Spendlove has the gift of storytelling. There's no pretense, no self-aggrandizing, or attempting to force feed a message. The series is pure joy, and I think this is an essential series for fans of urban fantasy or paranormal fiction.
It's easy to get drawn into the world of the Gnomes, and have their curious nature permeate your imagination. She never stops raising the stakes, which is a good thing. In other words, the stakes never plateau, but instead rise with each story. I also like the playfulness of her writing, and the very positive message she's trying to convey.
I can't recommend this series enough.
This was another enjoyable and engaging book by Janine Spendlove. I love the depth and detail she includes in her stories, the imaginative ideas and the fun of the book. The characters are very likeable and I was able to connect with them in a short time.
I read a copy of this book that was provided to me by the author. This is my honest review and I was not compensated in any way for providing it.
Another enjoyable installment of the Gnome Chronicles.
This author knows how to tell a story! The imagery is well done and I appreciate her not doing a cookie-cutter job of the story.
5.0 out of 5 starsGreat!
Another great story from this author! Can't wait to read the next one!
Fast paced read that draws you in and keeps you turning the pages. I love the Gnome characters and the relationship between Nora and Caffeine and the dragons. Can’t wait for the next book.
5.0 out of 5 starsI’m loving this series.
This was another great read. Looking forward to the next book.
I like the concept of this series, but there are problems. I don’t care much for the prose, and that’s not just the outsourced editing; it’s the author’s prose. It’s almost like she’s writing in the wrong genre. I get the feeling she doesn’t quite trust herself to be able to write simple clear sentences, so she just does what she feels she needs to do to meet the minimum word count.
I also didn’t care for the depiction of the heroine. She’s too girly-girly. I like characters who have lived through combat, who’ve gotten shot at and shot people and seen someone die in their arms. A girl who has only one summer of basic training in the Army and does one tour in Iraq, two months ago, who doesn’t have tattoos or PTSD doesn’t feel right to me.
What I think is worst, though, is that I don’t like her as a character. When she first appears, all she’s interested in is the war. That’s her job, not a life. She’s got little children who need her, and she leaves them in the care of her mother (?) in order to redeploy. That’s the writing equivalent of saying: “I’m out of here, dammit. You need me. Fine, you have me. But only until I decide I don’t.” That’s just lousy. No wonder her former lover, who apparently joined the Marines, left. He had to find someone who really loved him. Nora doesn’t.
It’s too bad, because the author has some good ideas for stories. I’m

Continuity mistake: At the beginning of series 2, episode 2, Watson has his driver's licence in his wallet. He offers it to Sherlock when he asks to look through his wallet. When Watson tells Sherlock what's in the envelope that Mycroft is handing to him, Sherlock takes out Watson's licence from his wallet. You can clearly see it's in his hand before he opens it. It's clearly not the same licence, and that one should be in the envelope.

But then nothing is too good to be true, especially when it comes to these creeps on their digital platforms, shouting about how they give returns to investors. Investment is always a risk, but how often do you have a risk and no reward? I’m not saying that the reward is always going to be what you want or expected, but you will get something. You can’t really not get something.
The man who came to the village had a story that was too good to be true. And he was a genius. According to him, he would grow three ears of corn from one seed. Some people laughed at him, and some people believed him. I was one of the people who believed.
The next day, he took a handful of seeds and went to the edge of town, where no one had been before. He placed each seed in the ground, making sure that they were properly planted, and then he stood back to watch them grow.
In about an hour, the man walked back into town with three hands full of corn. People were amazed and curious. They asked how he did it, but he didn’t say. Instead, he took his money and left.
Everybody was jealous of the man because he had found a way to grow three ears of corn from one seed. But there was another way to do it, and it was much harder. First, you have to find a place that is not used by anyone. Second, you have to make sure that you plant the seeds just right. And third, you have to be patient and wait until the right time.
The last one is the hardest part. You have to be patient and wait until the right time. And when that time comes, then you can reap the rewards.
Throughout the years, I have invested in countless schemes and business ventures that turned out to be too good to be true. I’ve been told about a company that will give you 1000% return on your investment.
One night, I’m awoken by a screaming woman running towards me. She looks at me and says, “There’s someone after me! Help me! Help me! Help me!”
I’m confused and she pulls me outside. She says, “You have to save me! He’s after me!”
I ask, “Who is after you?”
She says, “The mysterious stranger. He has been following me for months. He will kill me!”
I tell her that she should not go out after dark and that I’ll help her. She’s scared, but she lets me take her into the house and take care of her.
I ask her who the mysterious stranger is. She says, “I don’t know, but I’m sure he’s not good. He’s been following me for months. I’m scared.”
I tell her that she needs to stay in the house until I can figure out who the stranger is and what he wants. She says, “I don’t want to stay in the house. I want to go home.”
I tell her that she can’t go home until we figure out what’s going on. She says, “Okay, but I want to go home.”
I say, “Okay, let me get you some coffee.”
I go to the kitchen and make some coffee. When I return to the living room, she has already left.
The mystery man is the protagonist of the story. He is a stranger in town, but he is very popular. The people of the village believe that he can grow three ears of corn from one seed, and he has come to prove it.
When he goes to the edge of town, the people follow him. They are amazed that he can grow three ears of corn from one seed.

Only the first episode is out so far, and it was not amazing or anything.
The first half was pretty entertaining and I liked the characters, then things went bad and ended with a bad joke and a lot of filler. This was the joke:
If you will not understand that it was a joke, go watch the whole episode.
Characters were not very interesting, I did not like any of them. The fact that their names are girls names (except the guys) does not help, they just seem like boring girls and that's it.
Overall it was pretty bad, this had huge potential and went in the wrong direction in the end.

Nice start. First episode is not too overloaded with useless elements. Jokes are kind of stupid and what is worse some of them are spam-like. but well, not everything is so bad.

Posted by Mystic Seminole on Saturday, May 28, 2011
Jimmy Haggett trekked 220 miles alone across one of the most unforgiving landscapes on Earth, the Mojave Desert, an adventure to see if he could do it. In Jimmy’s own words, he knew he could never do it by himself so he enlisted the support of 646 friends who raised nearly $30,000 for Oceans Watch.
Below are some of his day to day reflections on his journey.
“Day one started by packing up my gear for 220 miles. My body was set and ready to do this trip, my mind was still in question. I can’t say that I didn’t have some doubts, but I was in this for 220 miles for a good cause. I can’t say that I didn’t have a little fear. I could imagine being so hot, so tired, being alone. How could I really tell how bad I would feel, or really what I would encounter. There is so much to this adventure. The thought of seeing myself for the next 15 days is definitely a deterrent. This was really hard for me to imagine and I was truly overwhelmed. My gear was pretty good. I didn’t have a lot of things to carry, except one case of water for each day.
"One of my goals was to cover about 10 miles the first day. I was hoping to just keep a steady pace throughout the trip. The day started off pretty good. I hiked about 4 miles and felt great. But shortly after the sun started to rise, the wind started to blow. It was at that moment I felt the temperature and got my first feeling of how hard this journey is going to be. The wind just blew hard, blowing about 15 mph. It didn’t seem like it was going to change too much that day and it only got worse. I decided to make camp early and take it easy.
"I got to camp around 5pm. I started the fire and made dinner. I was planning on camping that night and then hitting the road bright and early in the morning. My first day was supposed to be about 10 miles. I ended up hiking about 6.6 miles. I felt pretty good the whole trip. I was really surprised at how strong I felt. My mind was really good to me. I was really surprised at how strong I felt. I was really surprised at how good my body was. I was really surprised at how good my mind was. I was really surprised at how good my spirit was.
"Day two was not good. I got up early. It was a long time before it got light enough to see and I was very much looking forward to getting back on the road. I ate my breakfast and packed up. I really felt good about myself this morning. I felt like I could do anything. I was feeling good about the next 218 miles. I headed out on my way. I hiked another 11 miles. I made my way to camp where I ate dinner. I then put up my tent and went to bed. This was not a good night for me. I’m not sure exactly why. My head was just all over the place. My spirit felt good, but my mind was not. I wanted to be alone with my thoughts. I knew I had to push through this to get where I was going. I ended up hiking about 12.8 miles today.
"I got up about 3:30 this morning. I felt so much better today. Today started off with a lot of packing and preparation. I knew that this would be my hardest day. This is the day I planned to hit 20 miles. I felt good. I had no fear. I was ready to take this on. It was going to be a rough day. I was really worried. I started out strong and made it to the hwy. I wasn’t sure what to expect as I started my journey across the hwy. I got there and I just had to walk across.
"I continued my walk down the road and I was feeling good. This part was pretty rough for me, but I knew that I had to keep going. I kept telling myself, 'It is going to be easier than you think'. This was not going to be easy. I just kept telling myself that. I kept telling myself to stay focused. I knew there would be a time when I would be so tired. I kept reminding myself of this and I pushed through. About three miles into the h

The game comes with everything you need to play, an Adventure Book (with a spine!) and 28 of the new Dice Games pieces. All you need is a copy of the FAQ and you're ready to roll!
Note: This is a re-release of the game, the content of which is essentially the same, with some minor rule clarifications and a few new illustrations. There are also a handful of cosmetic changes in order to ensure the game is the right size for carrying around (with no extra cost for the content of the game!).
Dice Games is an easy-to-learn roll-and-move game that uses custom dice as its game pieces. This game is about rolling the dice, traveling across the board, and using your movement to activate the spells on the cards.
The game is intended for two or more players (aged 8+) and takes about 20-30 minutes to play.
The theme is very simple and has been developed over time. Originally, the theme was a Viking-esque adventure (think 'The Norse Saga'), but we felt it would be more fun to use weather as a motif, and so the adventures and gameplay take place in an 'all weather' world.
The game is designed to be fun for a variety of ages, from 8+ to adults, however there are some gameplay mechanics that may be difficult for children (of any age) who are unfamiliar with rolling dice. Therefore, we've identified a recommended age range for this game as 8+ years.
We've released a number of gameplay trailers over the last couple of years (and if you haven't already, please do check out the many others on our Youtube channel), but the trailer for Dice Games is the most detailed we've made yet! It shows the full gameplay and some of the behind the scenes production that went into creating the game.
This is a link to the Youtube trailer. If you want to find it on Youtube, the link is here.
We're passionate about what we're doing, and we're continuing to develop new gameplay elements and expand the range of the product line. Please let us know what you think! We always love to hear what you're up to, and if you're working on your own projects, please do send us pictures! We're happy to share our experiences and we hope you'll enjoy sharing yours with us!
Dice Games is intended to be a simple introduction to roll-and-move gameplay, so you can try it out on your own first, before learning the full rules. However, if you want a little more help, you can check out the FAQ here.
Some additional information for the purists out there - In our testing we played the game without using the Magic Rule card. We chose to do this to remove the additional complexity and keep the theme simpler. Therefore the recommended (and easiest) way to play the game is to just follow the rules on the 'Turn It Up' card. However, you do have the option to add the 'Magic Rule' into your game if you would like to complicate your gameplay by including the 'Magic Rule' card in your game.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact us using the form below. We're happy to talk games and ideas, or just to say hello.
We're excited to see what you come up with!

Young sailor's ears perked up and the daring adventures that would be faced one day, urged their feet to walk where they shouldn't, for the fear of failing. It was more than keeping up with the lads, it was "every man for himself", there was no "corporate ladder", no one helped the other, but such was the nature of island life. The young lads were too poor to afford their passage home, so if they returned it was back to the winds and the sea, for a boy of 14 or 15 years of age.
Let me paint you a picture for a moment. Let me bring you back into time, to the days of fishermen and islanders.
It was 1934, the Saturday night of the Lord Mayors Ball, a time where everyone dressed in their finest dresses and dinners, a great part of the yearly social calendar. Local fisherman Edward Parslow (Mayor for the forthcoming year) had spent his entire day practicing the quadrille and proudly instructed his daughters to take their places in his band of friends and family.
The guests were seated in the grand hall of St Mary’s church and Mrs C Gates was applauded as she took to the stage and, with the help of an orchestra of piano and accordion, she enthusiastically explained the rules of the quadrille.
The ladies gracefully assumed their positions and the quadrille began.
The party continued long into the evening with a fair amount of alcohol consumed and finally, around midnight, everyone left the ball to start making their way home.
As Parslow and his ladies began to walk towards the pier a large wave crashed into their group, knocking everyone down in the freezing waters, leaving the girls' bodies in view of their horror stricken fathers. After pulling them from the sea, it was evident that two of the ladies would not be joining them, even after attempts at resuscitation by three doctors.
Parslow continued to bathe his daughter with sea water for an hour before pulling her onto the shore, but the outcome of this was not what he had hoped for.
Edward Parslow and several other fisherman from the island continued to comb the coastline looking for any sign of his other daughter but, sadly, it was too late and the baby was already dead.
Parslow was arrested on suspicion of murder on 4 March 1935, and following an 8 month investigation and several witness statements, he was found not guilty at a full trial and ordered to pay costs of £37 12s 6d.
Grainy black and white video showing the rescue effort.
I am not going to give the full story of the Isles of Scilly's most tragic tale because it is a 30-minute radio documentary on Scilly FM and with the launch of the book this weekend.
If you can visit Scilly, go to Hugh Town on the 26th June to buy the book and hear the whole story first hand. I will be in the band of local fisherman telling the tale of Scilly and the Lady of the Isles.
Do check out Scilly FM's website www.scillyfm.co.uk if you'd like to listen to the podcast or download it for free.
The Ballad of the Lady of the Isles was composed by Marcus Holden, with the original release planned for 4th July on CD single through Scilly Records and distributed by Universal Music.
Here is a short film showing 10 unforgettable days spent in the Isles of Scilly.
Islands in the sea, magical and mysterious with its wild ponies and enchanted gardens. We are greeted with enthusiasm and grace by the Islanders who share their way of life. The scent of wild flowers and the sound of the sea engulf us as we explore some of the world's most breathtaking scenery.
An atmospheric visit to St Mary's, the largest island, highlights the local community's strong heritage and island living traditions.
Houses and streets are formed from rocks, clay and wild thorns, gathered from the cliffs and scrubland. Boats are lined up on the shore ready for the next voyage, women hang out their washing and fish is laid out to dry. We witness traditional butchering and join in an informal, friendly karaoke session. On the final day we accompany the 250 strong yacht race to St Agnes.

The book is a very quick read for an adult. I read the first 110 pages and found it entertaining, but am stuck because the remaining 145 pages are already out, and I will have to buy a second copy. My wife is reading another copy right now.
I gave the book a two out of five, because of the heavy-handed message of anti-religion, and the constant undercurrent of sexism. There were no redeeming female characters, nor were any women in a position of power. On the other hand, the story was interesting and the writing was decent.
I don't know about 50 years... more like a dozen. My wife is currently reading this book and it is a great story. However it is only about 300 pages long (350 if you count the Annotations which I think should be left out). There is no big takeaway that is as profound as some of the other suggestions.
I liked it, but it wasn't a once-in-a-lifetime favorite. I liked that it was an adventure story, and you could just sit down and read it. The message was less anti-religion than anti-power. It was more like an "I wish" story, as in I wish I could do magic, but not at the cost of a year without magic.
I read this book and it's quite delightful. Lots of humour and intrigue and variety and lovely worldbuilding and surprising twists and turns. I really like the 'swapped powers' element, and the device of these being unwanted powers. I like all the various backgrounds and powers and of course the wonderful adventure of the wizard quest. I think this was written to be a simple and fun adventure story, and I think it succeeds admirably. It's a wonderful light read and not difficult.
There were a few aspects I disliked, but it's mostly nit-picks and they did not detract from my enjoyment at all.
There are little magical moments, but nothing that involved actual magic. The story is set in a magic-using world, but what magic can they do? One witch can bake? Can all witches bake? That's the only magic we see. I'm not sure if the lack of interesting uses of magic is a nit-pick or a serious problem in the story.
I do dislike the undercurrent of the endlessly misogynistic male society. There were no redeeming female characters, nor were any women in a position of power. At the end of the day, all the authors wrote about was how awful these male, religious and traditional societies are. The only female character with any real power was the badass elf. She was unapologetically sexist to men, because "Men are such idiots!"
I'm not opposed to social commentary. However, if I'm going to spend the effort to read a story, I'd like to have the characters have some degree of integrity and something more to like than their independence. I know it's just a book, and not meant to teach us about the evils of the patriarchy, but having them be sexist, rude and insulting was a real turn-off. The only female character of note was the witch. I wish her magic wasn't just cooking and baking. If it had been, the story would have been fantastic.
3.0 out of 5 stars How Can a High Fantasy Fan Find a New Experience?
For me, The Wizard's Convention by Robert Rankin is a difficult book to review. I was a fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, in which The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is described as a dull, unfunny book.
As I mentioned in my reviews of Rankin's The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner and The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse, Robert Rankin is a fantasy novelist known for his sense of humor. Both these books were labeled "fantasy spoofs" because of their humor. I can't imagine anyone would read The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner and expect to be the next J.R.R. Tolkien.

Facing the music could be tough, but a formidable spirit and bold embroidery could be the perfect defense against what could be a dangerous situation. The legacy of making a difference through life is rewarding, but sometimes you’re stuck on a diet that has you crawling, and a relapse can be the result. You’re not alone in the dark, but the light of home could shine through the next morning, and you don’t know what to do until the sun shines through the clouds and you can make your way through the day.
Like a low hum, life can be stressful and difficult, but a quiet voice and the soothing glow of the stars can be a welcome relief. An apology can be a selfless gesture, but you don’t know what kind of mood it will be in. In a place as remote as the moon, a little disrespect can be the difference between a hole in the ozone and your own endangered species. You can’t chew on a string for too long, and there’s no time to rest while you’re still alive.
The Red Deer’s D-Shape: When a long-necked horse goes around a long road, there are times when there is a clear advantage to using a dead end. A “trap door” is a shortcut between two points of a connected grid that you can use as a quick escape route if you’re stuck on a path that ends in an exit. A high-profile scandal can expose you to criticism, but it can also be an opportunity to make your voice heard.

Hey, everybody. It’s weird to be writing again, but I’ve got some super important things to talk about that I think you’ll appreciate.
I have been working on my writing skills for the last year or so, and I am slowly but surely getting to a point where I am able to write a story without making a mistake. It is a huge accomplishment for me to write a story without making any mistakes, but I think it will help me to be able to tell more stories in the future.
The problem is, I have been having a difficult time writing stories about my life. I have been trying to write stories about my family, but I have been having trouble. I am not sure why, but I think I have been having a problem writing stories about my life because I am not sure what is wrong with me.

HEROES OF "Fantasy Island"
CRITICS OF "Fantasy Island"
Ultimately Fantasy Island is an ill-advised and moronic waste of time.
This is a horrific mess of an adaptation... One of the worst new releases of 2020.
To be kind, you could call this just one fantasy too many.
Fantasy Island is the equivalent of an unfunny cartoon.
The single-idea story plows ahead without any kind of clarity, and worst of all, it's repetitive. The Island is great at setting up ideas, but the script ultimately fails at carrying through with any of them.
Expecting the remake to live up to the camp, absurdity and gore of the original TV show is absurd.
Despite its bevy of star power and some of the campier turns it makes, Fantasy Island is still a long way from it.
Fantasy Island reminds us that you can pack any movie with just about any kind of movie star and gimmick and it can still turn out, well, like crap.
Fantasy Island isn't a good movie, but it's a hell of a lot of fun, even if it is its own worst enemy in the second act.
Despite its own inability to take a real crack at exploring the reason why people come to Fantasy Island and then the reason why they should never come to Fantasy Island, the film succeeds.
Despite all of its creative tinkering, Fantasy Island turns out to be one big dud, ultimately failing to live up to its pedigree and name recognition.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,007 - Generated text:  cliff by Cedric Corbit himself, prior to his execution for murder. But he was hanged on a Sunday, when the trees were in bloom, and he cursed the ones who would disturb his rest, and from that time on, on the nights when the moon was full and high, that cursed place was shunned. The curse was true, for on such a night the old soldiers of the Confederate Army, who had once worn the gray and bled the ground red in defense of a cause that was lost, came out in their spectral forms to wander the woods. Like so many from that time, they died with no thought of escape from the hell that was to come, and now their spirits remained, condemned to the dark and the cold, never to rest.

The body of Brisco Hawk was laid out in the small room of the house that was now his own. The frail candle guttered, and held back the light as if it were afraid to unveil a gruesome sight, while dust motes in the shadows swirled and spun, illuminated only by the fire in the grate and the moon outside the windows.

Brisco was very still. Even the grave and rhythmic beating of his heart was silent. The room was deathly cold, and his throat ached as he breathed in the fetid air that only filled such a place could.

There was a creaking and a rumbling and the fire-box in the grate sputtered and clanked, but his ear was attuned only to the faintest sound of breathing, and in the distance he thought he heard a voice whispering his name.

“Brisco,” it whispered.

“My God, who is it?” he whispered back, but only silence answered.

The room became more and more cold, and the walls were no longer closed in, but seemed to be stretching out to embrace him, and it was as if he were moving in slow motion, for his footsteps sounded slow and heavy as he stepped toward the door.

His fingers were damp and his hand was icy when he touched the knob, but he turned the doorknob only slightly, and leaned his weight against the door, pushing it just a little. It didn’t want to open, and with a supreme effort he pushed hard enough to make it budge. The door didn’t have the strength to resist him, and it opened and he felt a blast of cold air, the gale from the yard, on his face. He tumbled through the opening and nearly fell over the top step. He lay there for a moment, unable to move.

“Brisco?” It was the voice again. “Where are you, Brisco?”

“In the cold,” he whispered. “In the dark.”

“Come on, Brisco. You’re cold.”

He swallowed hard, and his body was trembling so that his teeth were chattering. He started to crawl to the hearth, where the coldness was at least warmed by the fire.

The voice spoke again. “Brisco, are you going to be a man about this, or do I have to carry you?”

“It’s cold, and my teeth are chattering.”

“Yes, I know. But you’ve been dead too long to die again tonight, and there’s not going to be much warmth in this room. I just want to carry you to the hearth, where you can get warm.”

“It’s so cold.”

“I know. You’ll be warm soon.”

“But who are you? It can’t be Cedric. I’ve seen Cedric. This isn’t Cedric.”

“No. No. I’m not Cedric.”

“Then who are you?”

“Cedric’s daddy.”

It wasn’t cold at all. Instead, Brisco’s mouth was dry and cracked and he felt hot all over.

“Dry and hot?” Cedric’s voice whispered, and the face of the boy filled his vision. Cedric was now a ghost, with bright and shining eyes, and Brisco remembered that Cedric always loved fire.

“You’re a ghost.”

“Yes. Come on.” Cedric walked out of the room and into the fire.

“Cedric, wait!” Brisco said. But Cedric was already burning up, the dry skin and b

2024-09-25 03:19:42,007 - Generated text:  both longstanding and international art world.
I have been in the museum world for quite a while. The remarkable thing is that our visitors - the public - also always bring something new with them. I could say that they may be somewhat better informed about the topic we are exhibiting, but I prefer to say that they are more demanding and critical than ever before. They expect museums to offer more, to cover a wider variety of topics. They expect new approaches, which provide new ways of thinking. So the museum needs to be able to provide stimulus, to inspire. And that is what we will be doing with our new museum.
A thousand years of art history at the Ostasiatische Kunstsammlung Basel – and 500 years of glass art at the Vitrocentre Romont. Thousands of Asian art objects are on show here, as are the world's best glass works. We've done what would have seemed impossible a few years ago – we've put together two top quality collections.
The topic for the exhibition is work and health in the 21st century. For the first time we are putting on a non-thematic exhibition in the baroque museum. The concept of this project is particularly close to my heart because I have already worked on the history of work. Many employees who are curators or exhibition designers take their interest and knowledge from what they see on a daily basis. But this is not just about them. It's about the visitors to the museum. People take interest in museums because they are interested in art. That may mean that they are more familiar with one particular topic or another, but in the end the museum will always be able to stimulate their curiosity, no matter what it is about.
Curator Silvia Malet is talking about a museum which, above all, presents exhibitions. For her, the task is to shape the content and the message and to convey them to the audience. But as a curator, she can only achieve that goal if the employees work in the spirit of the museum's credo: «The museum is an experience.» If the museum does not serve that purpose, if it does not set new standards, then the collection can simply be exhibited at the stock exchange. That would be a shame!
The new concept of the Vitrocentre Romont combines fascinating glass exhibitions with the VIDROCAFÉ, a connoisseur's café-restaurant, a shop, and an educational space. It also offers a new format, giving visitors the opportunity to admire the works of art in a peaceful environment.
Our passion is to create original and high-quality glass works of art for your home or business.
We love to surprise and delight our customers with inspiring, functional and expressive creations.
This year, too, is a special one for the Ostasiatische Kunstsammlung Basel.
By presenting in the museum you can see the Asian art from the 1950s to the present in a broader context.
Beautifully restored and renovated, the baroque Museum will be reopened in spring 2015. The project is one of the most important cultural projects in the city of Basel for the year.
Without VIDROCAFÉ, the world's best glass art is an empty shell!
For us, VIDROCAFÉ is not only a place for a delicious break in the city centre. The café is a source of inspiration, a laboratory and a place where customers and visitors can discover the world of glass.
Here you will find everything from glass art to connoisseur's wines, including the best Swiss gourmet dishes.
The temporary exhibition hall "Glass Experience" is a gallery for glass art, and presents the latest trends in art and design.
This is where you will also find permanent exhibitions with the best Swiss and international art glass.
With its culinary concept, the VIDROCAFÉ is the centre for glass connoisseurs and lovers of fine Swiss cuisine.
Here, in the VIDROCAFÉ you will find a variety of courses on glass art. Whether for beginners or professional glass makers, you will gain fascinating insights into the world of glass.
Let our connoisseurs inspire you, and enjoy lunch in a glass art laboratory with an unforgettable view.

Once it's down, he passes through a spiral-stair, which is on the top of the caged elevator. The caged elevator can be found in the very center of the room.
As the traveler makes his way down the spiral-stair, he hears a mysterious melody. Suddenly, a book appears, which contains directions to the room next to the caged elevator. After getting down from the elevator, the traveler gets stuck in some debris. A book containing the directions to the room where the Sentinel Horn is located can be found near the giant elevator's wheel.
The wheels are the easiest to destroy. The traveler smashes them with a hammer, which is present in the giant elevator, and one of the elevators comes to the first floor. When he breaks the glass panes to get the Sentinel Horn, the other elevator begins to collapse and the traveler gets trapped inside.
As the traveler leaves the room, he sees a mirror. Then, he sees his reflection turning back to the mirror. As the traveler goes forward and continues the melody, he enters another door. This time, the traveler finds himself in the dark room. He walks on the floor of the room, while hearing a melody coming from the barrels.
The traveler breaks the barrels and finds himself in a dark room. He finds a wooden plank in the corner, which is a puzzle piece. There is also a wooden boomerang in the room, which he puts in his inventory.
Then, he comes back to the room with the three Sentinel Horns, and puts the wooden plank back. The three Sentinel Horns break the brown block on the floor. The traveler then goes back and finds a power plant. It powers up the machine, which destroys the room and its contents.

Jessie tucked her chin down, folding her arms tightly around herself. She stood in the midst of rats, men she’d know by their deep purple robes.
Today the Master was resting in the inner chamber. The proper sign of respect.
It should have been the sign of a fool. A fool who trusted no one. A fool who didn’t believe in friendship.
But who were they to criticize when it was all the Master wanted? Jessie knew enough of the ancient rituals to see the signs.
The Master was a wizard—a worker of magic. He’d woven a little bit of their own history into this story, she knew.
Human nature to do that. Fill in the gaps.
Only Jessie knew the gaps were anything but empty.
Just as the Master kept the tapestry hidden, Jessie kept the truth of that tapestry hidden, along with the truth of her master’s own past.
Closing her eyes, she counted to twenty, waiting for the robed men to take their own leave. It wouldn’t do to shove them back in their hole, not so close to the time of the Master’s reign. He knew it could lead to unrest, unpredictable results.
She sighed in relief as they pulled the robes tighter around themselves and ducked down the hallway, their footfalls muffled by the stone.
But Jessie didn’t move to do the same. She knew the man who made those footfalls.
And she knew the tapestry of the woman’s face.
“Is it really just a tapestry?” It had once been her first question to the Master when she’d been an apprentice, and now she was no more, no less than she’d ever been. A servant, a slave, no more than a common girl.
Those days were behind her now, those empty promises of happily ever after. She’d spent fourteen years of her life toiling in the mines, learning the ways of the dark arts. Thinking it would pay off somehow in the end.
That somehow she could lift her head high again.
She’d been wrong. It hadn’t.
And in the last two weeks, she’d witnessed something she hadn’t known could exist.
The wall on the other side of the tapestry, the wall that the Master kept locked so tight, it took four of the guards to drag her over the threshold when she needed to pee at night. The wall they went to such lengths to protect.
Sleeping, of course. Of course, he was sleeping. It was all she’d heard for days. Sleeping in the east chamber of the castle, behind his locked door, tended to by a cadre of guards.
“It’s only a tapestry,” the Master had said, his grin baring the last of his rotting teeth.
“She’s dead,” he’d said, turning away from the tapestry, so that she wouldn’t see the woman on it had changed.
But that hadn’t been the first time.
If the girl was dead, then why would she get angry? Why wouldn’t she want to stay sleeping there? In the darkness?
Sleeping, of course. The Master had said he knew it was only a tapestry. That Jessie’s mind had created her dream.
“We all have dreams, don’t we?” he’d said.
But not a dream.
Jessie had seen the change. She’d known it hadn’t been her imagination, yet the Master kept her from the tapestry.
This time, the change was different. The woman was no longer asleep.
Was she asleep? Or did she mean for someone to see her?
“What is she trying to tell us?” The girl’s eyes stared at the woman on the tapestry as the woman’s lips moved, forming silent words that didn’t reach the girl’s ears.
“We can’t be sure,” Jessie had said.
But it wasn’t a tapestry. Not anymore.
And those chains…did they really matter? Could Jessie risk her life to protect the man she’d known all these years?
Just like that, she’d witnessed the Master change from the man who’d taught her all those years, to someone she didn’t know. Someone who treated her like a servant. Someone who thought it all right to make

CAMBIO article
The current building boom is characterized by an increasing volume of concrete and steel, with the boom of steel plants and cement factories coming from China. But here is the paradox: China wants to reduce its CO2 emissions, and it is in the middle of a transition from coal to solar energy.
Industrial facilities are always the first to adopt solar energy. In China, companies are piloting and optimizing solar solutions for the construction industry. From Sinopec’s massive solar energy supply to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, to Hangzhou Construction’s large-scale solar roof installed on its headquarters, renewable energy is moving the field forward.
Since 2013, with the gradual strengthening of China’s 516 emission control measures, China’s coal-fired power generation and coal-fired industrial boilers are under strict controls. After the photovoltaic policy, building insulation policy, the electricity industry has also been promoted for industrial upgrading.
An investigation by SZM conducted in September 2020 shows that China’s annual fixed-point solar installation capacity from January to September was 38.55 GW, reaching 48.43 GW. As of October 20, the cumulative installed capacity of industrial solar installations in China had reached 53.88 gigawatts. By the end of 2020, 56.25GW will be achieved, accounting for 56% of the total installed capacity of distributed solar power generation in 2020. In addition to the 100GW by 2020, Xie Zhenhua, China’s Special Representative for Climate Change Affairs, expects China’s new installations of solar power to be 210GW in the next 5 years.
Hangzhou Shengquan Decoration Engineering Co., Ltd., one of the city’s four largest green construction companies, is a well-known enterprise in the industry. It was incorporated in 2006, with an operating income of 305 million yuan and a total asset of 1.7 billion yuan in 2019. It is one of the main construction projects of Hangzhou Taoyuan Housing Construction Engineering Co., Ltd. It undertakes various construction projects such as comprehensive industrial parks, large-scale power plant decoration, and wharfs. Among them, Hangzhou Shengquan has invested more than 500 million yuan in solar energy. In 2020, it has completed more than 20 solar projects, with an installed capacity of more than 20 megawatts.
“Solar energy is definitely the best alternative to thermal power generation. Solar energy can be used in different ways to improve construction. It can provide convenient power for construction sites. It can also provide power for construction, such as special decoration projects.” said Jiang Yong, deputy general manager of Hangzhou Shengquan.
Hangzhou Shengquan’s headquarters are equipped with solar panels. The building is a prototype of environmentally friendly buildings that use environmentally friendly raw materials and recycled materials. It has also launched the “New Building Code for Solar PV Installation” and the “Decoration Engineering Design Code for High-Efficiency and Energy-Saving Decoration of Building Roofs”.
With its 30-year experience, Hangzhou Shengquan has always adhered to the development concept of “Safety, Ecology and Harmony”. In 2014, it was awarded the top 100 Enterprises for the Green Economy and received the “China Green Products Contribution Award” and other honorary awards from the China Construction Decoration Association and China Building Decoration Association.
Sinopec Shanghai Pudong Petrochemical Co., Ltd. is a domestic enterprise with strong overall strength and comprehensive capability in deep-processing and marketing of petroleum products. The company can provide safe and stable quality petroleum products and services, and has long been regarded as one of the most competitive manufacturers of petroleum products in the world. The company’s construction has reduced energy consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 25% compared to the reference scenario. It has also built one of the world’s largest photovoltaic power generation systems and installed a 100MW high-efficiency solar panel system on the roof

Once he had found her, he would be on to the next stop. The man in the red cap had given him the location of the Pythoness and the most efficient route, and he would need all his time to fulfill the night's commands.
Jubal was on a mission. For years he had maintained a friendly relationship with the city guard. Occasionally he would give them certain information that made their job easier, and in turn, they would share the spoils of the streets with him. It was a good arrangement, and it worked to the benefit of the common folk. This morning he had received a promise that the only person not to profit from his trip was the head Pythoness.
Jubal turned to the blue-haired, winged man who accompanied him on his venture. He chuckled at the minstrel's innocent face. "Don't mind him, Glyndil," he said, a hint of playfulness in his tone. "He thinks we're following through on our promise to keep the members of the community safe."
"Oh, I am," the angel insisted, his voice scratchy and unused. He began to sing.
"When we find a rebel in the street,  
_When we find a rebel in the street,_  
Then we stop him in his tracks,  
_Then we stop him in his tracks,_  
And then we lop off his head!"
Jubal laughed. "Not only would that ruin your musical style, but you couldn't stop a rat from running away."
Glyndil ran his fingers across the strings, and in no time, the melody turned from wild to soothing. "Now this is more like it, Glyndil. I love your way with words and music."
"It is a talent," the angel boasted. He did not protest when Jubal's friends from the guard began to move in behind them. One of them began to sing, the tune joining in with the angel's. "There once was a noble knight  
"Who wore a pointy hat  
_And a suit of shining light_  
"And a tall helmet on his hat.  
And a sword stuck out of that,  
And a sticky cape behind him  
And a shield he held before him  
And he looked out for me and you."
Jubal looked at the crowd of people moving behind them. "I can only hope we will have as much fun discovering the head Pythoness as we're having with you two."
Glyndil hushed them again with his quieting song. In a little while, all was quiet, and they were as good as invisible in the back of the bustling crowd. Soon they came upon the guard captain, holding a tall man who had been brought in by patrolmen.
Jubal was not surprised to find that the man was named Sabir. "I was doing my business in the park when I spotted a woman meeting with an armed group," he explained to the captain. "I took out my blade, and they ran."
The captain's eyes widened with anticipation. "Any others with them?"
Sabir shrugged his shoulders. "Too hard to tell, but we did get this one."
The guard captain nodded with approval. He didn't bother to say what would happen to Sabir for breaking the rules by stopping what he should have left to the street guard. Jubal took this as a sign that the captain trusted Sabir's account, and the two men shook hands.
Jubal and Glyndil moved through the throng, and soon they came to a group of soldiers guarding a door. When Jubal approached, the captain called out to him. "We have this man who is a famous law maker. It's a huge honor for the city to have him staying here."
"Who is it?" Jubal asked.
"The head Pythoness," the captain answered.
Jubal rolled his eyes. The head Pythoness was not to be the first one he took care of. He turned to the man. "Sorry," he said, "I won't be able to speak to her today. I have important business to attend to in the morning."
"Do you have any idea when you might return?" the captain asked.
"It could be tomorrow," Jubal responded. "Are you sure she is not a danger to the city?"

A FANTASTIC FUTURISTIC EPIC ADVENTURE!
This is definitely worth every single cent of the minimal cost!
I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced, page-turning thrilling adventure story. I'm hooked on this series already!
It is an exhilarating mix of science, suspense and an adrenaline-fueled race against the clock! The combat scenes are thrilling and visceral with a touch of futuristic technology to up the ante, the sci-fi is on point and the story is both epic and intimate. The author combines it all with a taut-knit cast of characters that made me care about them. The pace is fast with no let up, and you will be surprised at how much you care about the characters as the stakes are raised and how the action keeps escalating.
This is the first novel in a series and I enjoyed the self-contained quality of this particular adventure while providing just enough of an overall 'macro' view to allow me to become fully immersed in the action. The 'Prequel' novel is especially recommended for those who have not read any of the other novels.
I truly enjoyed this book, with a few minor qualms about a few too many male gazes being thrown at main female characters. But those are few and far between. I had trouble putting this one down and I can't wait to find out what's next for Avery Johnson.
Book 2 - THE KISS OF KAMAKURA
I received a free copy from NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.
Major Avery Johnson heads to space on a dangerous mission. There they discover a mysterious object in the solar system and a competition for its power begins. The survival of humanity hangs in the balance. The ARTEFACT is fast paced and immersive. This is the first of a series of books that features Major Avery Johnson, an amazing character that carries you through the story and allows you to share her adventures in a unique way. This is also the first book in the Wave series, where the characters are in dire straits from the very beginning, with the situation becoming progressively worse as they face a series of challenges. This book has the perfect mix of drama, science fiction, and action that makes for an incredibly thrilling adventure. I can't wait for more!

The garden itself, containing a glasshouse filled with orchids, is now part of Buckingham Palace. The path the King and Queen took to the glasshouse can still be followed by visitors.
The rambler rose (often known as climbing rose) was bred by English nurseryman, Reverend Robert Cerdes in the 1860s. He is also known as the father of the rose.
King George V inherited the English court from his mother. He preferred to live in England rather than at Sandringham or Balmoral, because his elder brother (Edward VIII) lived at Buckingham Palace and could enjoy his mother’s former palace. The Queen also inherited a love for their shared home, and has continued the tradition of buying flowers from London’s flower markets, which are still in existence.
1901 saw the first outdoor summer cricket match played in the gardens, which also hosted its first tennis tournament.
Buckingham Palace is home to a unique pollinator garden, an environment for bees, butterflies, and hoverflies to thrive and bask in the spring and summer sunshine. The Pollinator Garden includes a 35-metre Wildflower Meadow planted with perennial native flowers which attract pollinating insects to the garden.
In his memoir, his wife Queen Mary wrote that, while they both had their own interests, they had the same tastes: “I think we both like the English garden most, as we did in our childhoods”.
“It is the atmosphere of the garden – the sights, sounds, smells – and the kind of gardening that we love and that you, dearest friend, will remember us by.”
The gardeners at Buckingham Palace pride themselves on a hands-on approach to cultivation. When the Royal Household tried to increase the number of green-fingered staff, The Queen stopped them, saying “I can’t stand seeing those plants being swamped by pruning every week.”
Buckingham Palace was built on the site of Queen Mary’s family home, a manor owned by the Duke of Buckingham. By the time of his death in 1735, he had built a grand mansion for his young widow. She carried on living there with her 24 children.
The original gardens were created by William Blake, who made the first drawings in the early 1800s. It was through him that the botanist John Molesworth Taylor came to visit the property and wrote a letter to a friend detailing his observations. The garden is laid out on a classical principle, with parallel paths and fountains. He admired the blue and white china and the large round topiaries.
Queen Victoria’s love of flowers and gardens is well known. After a tour of Buckingham Palace in 1862, she wrote “the Park is the loveliest thing I have ever seen. The flowers are so beautiful and so well kept; everything is so bright, clear and airy, and you feel so peaceful.
The gardens of Buckingham Palace are a living testament to the love of a family for its home, of flowers and of one another. They were designed with the intention of providing a tranquil and serene setting for the Royals to enjoy.
Buckingham Palace began life as a country house built for the Duke of Buckingham. In 1761, the Duke sold the estate to Prince George of Wales, who later became King George III.
In 1764, the Duke of Buckingham commissioned architects John Carr and Robert Adam to design a new building on the site. The project was completed in 1771 and the house was named Buckingham House.
George III’s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, inherited Buckingham House in 1801. After his accession to the throne in 1820, the Prince commissioned architect John Nash to design a major rebuilding of the house, including new stables, an annex and a great ballroom.
The interior of Buckingham Palace was also redecorated in a lavish neo-classical style. Among the new features were a throne room, banqueting hall, and state apartments.
The gardens of Buckingham Palace were designed by landscape architect John Nash in 1824. The gardens were laid out on a formal geometric plan with a central avenue flanked by double flower beds.
The planting scheme was based on a scheme devised by William Baxter for the gardens at K

A heady, page-turning fairy tale from one of Finland’s most accomplished writers.
Susanna Clark was born in Los Angeles in 1971 and moved to Finland with her family in 1978. She has written eight previous novels, all of which have been published in several European languages and two of which have been translated into English. Daughter of Eden was published in the United States in 2012. She is currently working on a collection of short stories. Susanna Clark lives in Helsinki.
Translated from Finnish by Owen Witesman
Literary, Magic, Fantasy, Translation, Fairy Tales, Young Adult
“Mythical creatures and mystical shenanigans are big business in children’s literature these days… The urge to depart our world to find a simpler one elsewhere is very strong in young people—and no wonder. If it weren’t for fairy tales, we would all have to figure it out for ourselves.”
“Clark’s writing is luminous, her characterizations warm, her plot intriguing, and her ending almost perfect. Readers will feel as if they’re living in a fairy tale.”
“...discover this fascinating author who writes like a Celtic folk tale. … Susanna Clark is a sensitive writer, true to both the children and their world, and her prose is also absolutely beautiful. The illustrations by Antti Alanen complement the magic of the story, making this a book for adults and children alike.”
“Susanna Clark writes beautiful fairy tales that are right on the knife edge between adult and young fiction, in the tradition of Angela Carter and Susanna Clarke. ... The Language of Daughter is a dark, bewitching tale, a tale to enjoy by both adults and young readers alike.”
“Susanna Clark makes the journey across the river of time to the heart of the Finnish midwinter festivals in this beautiful tale. The witch-like grandmother who longs to remember her youth and her loved ones is a haunting image as are the daughters who seem half-beast half-maiden. It is this push and pull, the balance of opposites, that gives the novel its poignant and gorgeous strength. The novel is a gift of bread for the soul.”
— Linda Hogan, author of People of the Whale
“An astounding first novel with all the magic of a fairy tale and the elegance of a diamond pendant. It is a celebration of our capacity for wonder, and a reminder that life is never completely beautiful or broken, but somewhere in between. I read The Language of Daughter in two sittings and loved it every page of the way. ”
— Susan Richards Shreve, author of The Weight of an Act and The Whispering
"In her lovely debut novel, Susanna Clark captures the haunting beauty of the northern winter and its enchantments, from the lyric opening to the mysterious ending. Set during Finnish Midwinter celebrations, this luminous fairy tale about the relationship between mothers and daughters holds readers rapt as it explores what it is to be loved, to love, and to lose. In The Language of Daughter, Clark's remarkable storytelling weaves traditional Finnish folklore and modern storytelling together to create a magical tale filled with lyricism, hope and, at times, sorrow. It is a book for the heart."
— Natasha Yim, author of The Kite Fighters
“The Language of Daughter is a touching fairy tale of the heart that is also a rich page-turner, full of surprise, heartbreak and happiness. Clark weaves a beguiling, mystical spell that will appeal to anyone, adult or child. Owen Witesman’s translation makes this book sing in English.”
— Chloe Aridjis, author of Asunder
“This novel is rich in emotion and detail and Clark's writing is atmospheric and lyrical. It tells of a family caught between their old life and the uncertain future ahead, and the impact their choices will have on their children. When a mother comes across a well that promises to grant all desires, will she be wise enough to avoid temptation? It is an inspiring and relevant story

2024-09-25 03:19:42,009 - Generated text:  clues hidden in centuries-old stories.
In March 2013, two University of Utah students made an exciting find in the Special Collections vaults. A collection of correspondence among several early Mormon converts led the students to an ancient book of LDS Scripture, the Book of Commandments, with a small personal notation, "Christian Goodloe – The Key to Utah Treasures." After this discovery, the L. Tom Perry Special Collections went in search of Goodloe's treasures.
Who was Christian Goodloe?
A pioneer entrepreneur, Goodloe arrived in Salt Lake City in 1850 and rose to become a business leader during the gold rush era. In 1856, he made history when he successfully steered a wagon train of settlers and supplies to San Bernardino, California, through rough desert country. His remarkable feat is documented in newspapers of the time. Goodloe had established a reputation for grit, determination, and integrity by the time he entered into a partnership with his wife's brother, Robert L. Gibson.
Goodloe worked hard to secure his position in the frontier town of San Bernardino. His business ventures included the San Bernardino National Bank, the county court house, the Bank of San Bernardino, and many other enterprises, both public and private.
However, many in town were opposed to Goodloe. They argued that he brought miners into the region to exploit the silver mines. At one time, Goodloe was threatened with a lynching for his business ventures, and for his charge that General Howe, commander of the U.S. Army in California, was involved in gold mining.
During these years of political and economic turmoil, Goodloe continued to quietly serve his community. He raised $40,000 to build the Mountain View Hotel, and he was elected to the board of trustees of the San Bernardino Public Schools.
Mining notebooks
In 1875, Goodloe wrote down his observations and advice on mining for gold and silver in California, which he called "How to Make Money." His book was printed and bound into booklets, with over a hundred copies distributed as promotional material to lure settlers to San Bernardino. He wrote that it was "nothing more than a book of mining lore and experience, obtained by the writer from years of observation, and the result of observation on numerous properties."
The booklets appear to have been a marketing strategy. They included a map of San Bernardino, a coupon for the Mountain View Hotel, a letter of introduction to several mining companies, and several stories that Goodloe wrote to encourage prospectors. The stories included the adventures of Goodloe and his wife in the gold country, and Goodloe's ideas on how prospectors should conduct themselves while making their way across the desert.
In the last story, Goodloe wrote:
There are rich lodes of precious metals in the wash of our mountain streams. . . .I cannot undertake to enumerate or describe these mines, but as our territory is fast being occupied by so many intelligent and able citizens, who can soon establish a mutual system of exchange, there will be a constant demand for them.
I am sure that with my knowledge of mining and the country, I could make as good a fortune as anyone. I am perfectly well aware that some of these great mining companies would welcome my services, but it would not be agreeable to me to enrich my employers at the expense of my fellow citizens.
Many of Goodloe's mining notebooks are in the Special Collections, and it was one of these that caught the attention of the students who found the reference to Christian Goodloe and his key.
Was there ever a key?
Some have claimed that Christian Goodloe kept a safe hidden somewhere in Southern California, with information about the location of the lost mines of California. However, no mention of such a safe or hidden key has ever been found. In fact, in the notebooks, Goodloe repeatedly expressed skepticism that a hidden key to finding riches existed in California.
So is Christian Goodloe's book of mining lore, "How to Make Money," really "the key to Utah treasures"? To find out, we need to find out what is buried in the stories.
Discover the secrets of Christian Goodloe’s “Key to Utah Treasures” and learn the story of the discovery.
I loved the format of this book. The information about the writer of the book, the old mining stories, and

We felt pride in knowing that many of his career accomplishments were from here in our region, including supervising the development of sailing and canoeing programs in Anchorage, serving as the 100-mile kayak relay’s inaugural race director, overseeing trail and campsite building for the Mat-Su Wilderness Challenge and bringing together community members from every area and demographic to set a world record by completing 2,300 miles on the Hatcher Pass Trail.
We now have his memory, his life, and we have the words of another friend who reflected, “My friend Bruce was a Renaissance man, a free spirit who followed his dreams and inspire others to do the same.”
At the end of the day, we are who we are because of each other. Bruce was selfless in making sure everyone had a safe, fun and memorable day. To the very end, he would offer this advice, “When it comes to that big challenge ahead, take a chance and leap from the bow.” He was happy that he got to fulfill his lifelong dream of retiring on a cruise ship. Now that he’s returned to the sea, he will be happily remembered by everyone he touched, all of us and everyone we know.

“The book will speak its own dialogue. . . . Monster Magic has a playful feel, both in its prose and in the conversations it imagines between a teenage magic student and his magical spellbook.”
“Readers looking for an inoffensive magical tale with family appeal will not be disappointed with this book. The characters are likable and easy to get to know, and the illustrations enhance the text.”
“Ringberg’s (Cats with Scissors) simple, comedic text is not overwhelming, yet the characters are complex enough to be relatable and the dialogue is clear and crisp. Readers will enjoy working through some of the magic words that are included. The illustrations, with their cheery nature and simplistic style, complete the story. It’s easy to see why this tale is intended for the school setting.”
“Children will relate to the boy’s angst and how it affects him both at home and school, even though he uses magic. They will find the book relatable, as well. . . . A fun and entertaining addition to the new breed of magical stories.”
“Mereyn recounts a fairly typical story arc of a Harry Potter–wannabe with a few differences. For one thing, he has little to no magical skills (more than enough of a reason for embarrassment on its own). In another, his spellbook—a bound volume—is far from the indispensable tome he thought it was. Its creepy and carping pronouncements as the book’s talking pages frustrate him—and sometimes remind him why he shouldn’t be working magic. Both Mereyn and his book are engaging characters that readers will root for.”
“Monster Magic is a quick and quirky read, full of humor and fun. A quick read that is perfect for the fantasy lover who may not have time for anything lengthy.”
“This entertaining book will be enjoyed by children ages 7 to 12 who enjoy the magical worlds of Harry Potter and Inkheart. Readers will enjoy the story, but they may be even more intrigued by the potential of creating their own magical spellbook—a fun activity for any Harry Potter fan.”

“Mereyn . . .” said the voice. “That’s you, right? I think I can manage a M, S, and Y, but I’m not sure about the N.”
“Oh, I don’t blame you!” Mereyn interrupted, jumping up from the table. “That’s only a secondhand book, after all. You’ve only used it once or twice!”
This was so unlike my magic books. In books from the library, the magic was there; all you had to do was follow the instructions carefully, and the magic would happen.
The book spoke again: “It looks like you need to study!”
“Not all the pages will talk,” Mereyn said, plucking the book from my hands. “Only this one.”
I scowled. My magic had turned out so well so far. There was no reason this book couldn’t talk, too. I had done the exact same spell before!
“You are right,” Mereyn said, walking to the living room. “You need to study more.”
She dropped my book onto the couch and settled onto the cushion. The flame in the gas fireplace grew brighter. I bit my lip, folded my hands in my lap, and waited. I didn’t want to admit it, but the book’s comments had gotten to me. Maybe I should study more

As far as traditional banquets and awards dinners go, these two had been pretty dull affairs, what with the exception of one year when Alvin had shown up with a woman he claimed to be his mother, and when he had won the Pity Award for Best Speech, which he couldn't have possibly written, as he didn't know how to spell.
But this year, strange things happened, some very strange things.
On the outskirts of the crowd of members, Asher and Shamir grabbed and then flicked and tossed a disk of pale brown fur.
They had already made many rounds of the room, waiting for someone to notice them and walk to the door.
When Brian Kennet, the League president, spotted them, he was on his way to give his speech. He smiled as he approached them.
"Now what's this all about?"
"Why, it's simple," Asher said. "We're demonstrating that—"
"Can it, Asher. I know the drill," Brian said, nodding and smiling at them. "Anything you say will take too long. Just say it and get out. Here's my speech."
He held out the disk of fur, and then walked toward the podium to accept his speech for Best Ridiculous Speech.
While he read his speech, which he had written and memorized, Asher and Shamir watched and waited. They didn't have to wait long. Soon the crowd began to boo and hiss and shout, and Brian rushed off the stage.
Shamir dashed away and up a flight of stairs and into a classroom where he and Asher had hidden a bomb. Asher stayed below to meet Brian.
Shamir set off the bomb. A loud boom rattled the windows and alarms sounded.
Shamir rushed back down to the meeting room as Brian Kennet came flying down the stairs. He nearly knocked Asher over.
"What happened?" Brian demanded. "I was told to meet you here!"
"There was a small problem," Asher said.
"What problem? You blew up a building! Are you crazy?"
"There was no building. It was a plastic model. The rubble and dust were all pulverized."
Brian stared at him for a long moment, then relaxed.
"Okay, so what do you want?"
"We need your help with something," Asher said. "It's a very important matter."
"Just get to the point," Brian said, following him through the crowd.
"We need your help with something."
"You've already told me that," Brian said.
"Yes, but what are we doing for you in return?"
"Oh."
"So? How about it?"
Brian smiled. "I owe you one."
"You can pay it back any time," Asher said.
The league, or what was left of it, now that it was made up of only two members, went about its business. The League of Extraordinarily Shy Superheroes was officially disbanded.
But if you came back in ten years and looked up the records, you would find that for the next ten years, a letter addressed to Dr. Alfred Asher, or Dr. Shamir Muller-Levi, the two, having decided that they were now the League of Extraordinarily Shy Superheroes, had been doing a very good job of hiding themselves from each other.
But if you went back in another ten years, you would find that there were still two guys living in an apartment in New York who claimed they were superheroes, only they were much older and grayer and they now had the bags under their eyes to prove it.

It had lived through the sunrise and sunset of eras. It was here to live through the centuries, yet again. The tree was determined to be the leader in whatever life brings. It would continue to stand proud.
The very first sign of life was felt. A faint whisper could be heard from the wind. It spoke to the tree. The tree felt calm. It’s branches had been through winds of all kinds and felt no fear. The wind spoke again. The branches whispered. The whispers grew stronger and more powerful. The wind carried those whispers all the way to the roots of the tree. The tree felt warm. It felt loved. The leaves that were sleeping inside the tree turned green again. It was time to wake up. The buds were about to open and the seasons would change.
The wind carried with it its own mighty branches. They were strong and powerful. They were ready to fight through every storm and bring back the peace to the tree.
I felt my body start to shake, from the inside. I looked around the old home, yet again. It had been many days since I’d been here. Each day, I’d been here, but never for long. I was a shadow, restless, hiding, struggling, failing, growing. Growing again. No. Not failing. There were things to do. I had been out of my work all of my life. People would think, we were lazy, useless and everything in between. I was used to being told that, and we had always been alright. Some people believed we lived a life filled with riches and blessings. We worked hard, all of us, and we lived well. That was before.
This was different. Everything had changed. The war had ended. The people had left. The soldiers had left. We’d been living in peace. The silence that hung in the air was no longer a blessing. We could feel fear. We could feel our future and our lives were about to change. I felt uneasy. The voice inside my head was louder than the one outside my window. It reminded me of all the things that had happened. It made me believe I was useless, weak, dumb and all the other terrible names people called me. It was self talk and it told me I was alone, no matter how much I’d grown. I was wrong. I was the leader. I was about to take my first step. I just needed to remember, I was the one in charge.
Suddenly, the voice became louder. It called me weak. Weak? My entire life, I’d been called stupid and weak. I wasn’t weak. This was my chance to prove it. I had been asked to lead and I would not be left alone to fail. I would not. There was too much at stake.
Weak? I may have been a little scared, but I was not weak. I was strong. I needed to be strong for everyone else, so they could feel safe, even if they didn’t know they were scared. I had to take my first step. I just needed to make sure it was the right one.
I slowly opened my eyes. The wind whispered again and brought with it a smile. I took a deep breath and looked around. Everything looked different. My perspective was different. I saw the home I loved. I saw my bed. I saw the walls, the trees and the blue skies above me.
I looked at the home I loved, and even though it was different, I felt happy. I felt strong. The right first step had been taken. I remembered what I loved and took the right step. I walked back in and the world looked different. The journey had started and I was not alone. The wind spoke with its mighty branches. It called me strong. I was not weak. I was not weak. I felt stronger than ever. I knew that I was in charge and I knew I was about to make a difference in my life and the lives of those around me.
I didn’t know how or when or where or even how long I’d be there. I didn’t know what the future would bring. But I did know, that I was stronger than ever before. I was brave. I was a leader. I had found my way back home.
This is a beautiful way of using metaphor to describe our journey back to

2024-09-25 03:19:42,010 - Prompt 95: Unraveling the mysteries of the deep sea, researchers find
2024-09-25 03:19:42,010 - Generated text:  record-breaking fishes off California
We’re learning more and more about the deep sea every day thanks to a series of explorations known as “Deepwater Explorers.” Each trip has provided stunning footage and scientific data on these largely unexplored areas. Most recently, scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, Northeastern University, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and other groups combined forces and descended thousands of feet below the surface to collect some truly amazing samples.
Two new species were caught during the expedition, which spanned from July 7 to August 31, 2018, in Monterey Bay, and one of them, a fish known as Uranoscopus scintillans, is the deepest-dwelling vertebrate ever discovered. It was found at depths of 3,200 meters (10,500 feet). What’s most interesting about this find is that the fish can be found at great depths in every ocean on Earth. It appears to live both in mid-oceanic ridges and on the edges of oceanic basins.
With two discovery dives already in the books this season, we have two new species and the second-deepest discovery at 3,200 meters #DeepSeaExplorer pic.twitter.com/HVfSChJ0Qq
— Ocean Exploration (@ExploreOcean) July 31, 2018
“The discovery of a new species at these extreme depths highlights the amazing and unexplored diversity of life that inhabits the deep sea,” says Scripps Institution of Oceanography researcher Luke Rendell, who was on board during the expedition. “Deep-sea exploration is still relatively rare. We were amazed to find this new species on our first and only exploration of this area. We will definitely be doing more.”
While the new species is the deepest-dwelling vertebrate on record, the bristlenose electric ray, which was captured at a depth of 4,990 meters (16,371 feet) during the expedition, is the deepest fish caught to date. Previously, that honor went to another anglerfish species, the Hawaiian viperfish (Chauliodus dentatus), which was captured by a team from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in the summer of 2015 at a depth of 4,658 meters (15,282 feet).
The specimens collected by the Deepwater Explorers team during the expedition will be used in a variety of ways. They will be analyzed to learn more about the chemical makeup of the area, and will be examined in depth for their ecosystem services, including food for marine life and potential uses for human health. They will also be used to test several technologies used for deep-sea exploration.
A collaborative project between The E/V Nautilus, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, Northeastern University, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) in 2015 was the deepest known sighting of an animal (Cryptochirus speciosus) in the history of exploration. The team photographed and filmed the eyeless, barnacle-covered deep-sea angler fish at a depth of 7,240 meters (23,753 feet).

2024-09-25 03:19:42,010 - Prompt 96: A diary from the 18th century reveals life stories and secrets about
2024-09-25 03:19:42,010 - Generated text:  the noble families who frequented the Saxon coast
The iron seal of the villa on the Spit-heath near Plön in Ostholstein
Hans Hedemann/Wikipedia Commons
The 20-metre-long lime trees around the old moat must have provided a blissful shade in summer, although the climate has changed considerably over the past 250 years. This is what one of the inhabitants of the Spit-heath villa in Plön had written in his diary in the year 1771. During the Saxon coast tour, we have been to many places where nature and the tranquillity that surrounded the nobles have left deep traces in a hundred years. We have seen a fine example of this during the tour, because history seemed to have flown like a butterfly from hand to hand. It started on the old Watzendorf moor near Plön, from where we looked over the Spit-heath towards the Wacken tower on the Eckernförde Bay. A windswept castle gave a view of the old village on the Spit-heath, where time seemed to stand still. And, according to the Diary of Franz Ignaz von Waldow, written in 1771, "the castle on the heath" was probably the summer residence of the Würzburg Archbishop Ferdinand Maria Anton Raimund von Raunitz (1709-1783) - a man who was considered to be one of the most influential figures in the European diplomatic service. In addition to the courtier in the service of the Prussian kings, who took over as prince-bishop in Würzburg in 1754, he is also regarded as a pioneer in the economic development of Saxony.
The Seal of Prince-Bishop von Raunitz
The fact that the lonely traveller from Hamburg saw the Spit-heath and the impressive Watzendorf moor, known as the Venerabilis Montis ("honourable mountain") around 1700 - 50 years earlier than the trip report - is probably due to the fact that he lived here in 1754 for some time and had to be familiar with the house for the geographic classification and description of the area in his travel report. He also gave a description of the exotic plants that the archbishop planted on the house's botanical garden. A courtier in the service of the Prussian kings from 1737 to 1783, the courtier was assigned by King Frederick II (1712-1786) to Würzburg in 1754. Until his death, the man called von Raunitz was named prince-bishop and acted as the head of the German Confederation, as well as diplomatic negotiator and foremost promoter of science, literature and art. It is not surprising that he lived in the Spit-heath castle for the summer. After all, the castle is strategically located between the Holstein Castle and the Eckernförde Bay in the central area of the Saxon coast. Like many places of the old Prussia, the Saxon coast seems to be more than a place to spend a holiday.
The ruins of the summer house are still located on the edge of the Watzendorf heath
The location of the building is strategically placed at the junction of the Eckernförde Bay and the Holstein Castle. Because the summer house was not surrounded by a thick forest, the guard must have been very important. Like other noblemen from Saxony, he was probably interested in hunting here. And he seemed to have been fond of the lonely place. At least, the ruins of the summer residence are still located on the edge of the Watzendorf heath. With time, more and more visitors seem to discover the historic location. After all, it is the only romantic place for a person on the Saxon coast. It is certainly not a coincidence that the house was supposed to be designed by Prince-Bishop von Raunitz himself. "During this trip, I travelled a short distance to the Spit-heath castle, which was also built by the archbishop on the moor," writes the Prussian king's courtier in his diary. With an "H" and an "L" at the end of the year, the man named von Raunitz recorded a circle that seemed to have run around. And after all, these two letters could probably be used as a code for Hase und Lerchen, which, according to the naturalist Ernst von Raunitz's explanation, means hare and partridge. However, the managing director of

Stalactites dripped down onto the floor of the cave, where they piled up into bulbous shapes over the years. As the ceiling collapsed from the weight of the glistening formations, the tunnels were sealed.
An eyeless creature with bony limbs was discovered entombed within the cave. The ancient creature was frozen in a position indicating that it had been buried alive, though its mode of death is unknown.
An 1890 wooden shoe, also known as a klompen, was found in the cave. The shoe was said to be a favorite of the legendary Dutchman Willem Van Der Decken, who was known to frequent this region of the country.
The village of Kevelaer, which was discovered near the entrance to the caves, is known for being home to thousands of ghostly figures who are said to visit on specific dates throughout the year.
This statue, known as the St. Winfrid statue, has been the subject of numerous supernatural incidents over the years. Witnesses report the figure crying.
According to local folklore, the earth erupted and engulfed the entire village. The man was burnt to death in his armchair while protecting his beloved horse from the inferno.
One of the hulks was discovered wearing an iron helmet, indicating that the man may have been a knight. Other skeletons were discovered near him, indicating that there were other soldiers who may have died during the war.
Prayer books were found littering the cave, as the chamber was converted into a Christian chapel in the year 1148. Over the years, the structure was covered over with rubble and mud, leaving the crypt abandoned.
Due to the unique conditions inside the tunnel, the bodies were remarkably well-preserved, despite the age of the site. The corpses are also remarkably intact, with flesh still on the bones.
Some of the individuals may have been buried in full clothing. According to researchers, this indicates that the person was an important member of society.
Though the villagers continued to report sightings of the little girl, they did not take the sightings seriously. In 1918, the girl was captured on film, along with her friend, a ball of smoke.
The tunnels of the cave were covered in dirt from 1914 until 1936, when authorities discovered human bones.
In order to make the buildings appear as if they were still standing, the Nazis erected walls of brick and wood on the site.
The skull of a man was discovered lying on the bank of a river near the city of Huerth. Researchers believe the skull may have belonged to a French soldier who was killed in the Battle of 1940.
In the spring of 1945, the Gestapo rounded up the villagers and brought them to the cave for questioning. Though no one was ever reported missing, many locals suspect that some of the villagers were murdered by the German police.
The couple, both of whom were found in bed, were buried head-to-head, indicating that they were not close. They both were said to have been lovers, and some have speculated that they were buried together to keep them together.
Many of the skeletons found in the caves were thought to be the remains of murder victims. According to archaeologists, the stabbing wounds were most likely made with a knife.
The skeletons were discovered in 1963 by locals who were hunting rabbits. A tree was later planted on the site, which is known as the Tree of Life.
The discovery of bones is not uncommon in the forests of Lampeter, which is located in Wales.
This pit, known as a fosse, was located within the ruins of the city of Huerth. Researchers believe that the pit was used as a prison, and that the skeletons found within were the remains of people who were sentenced to death.
In the town of Lampeter, Wales, a skeleton was discovered with several injuries, including a missing left arm. Some believe that the skeleton was the victim of a medieval war.
The cremated remains of a young woman were found in a stone crypt, which was believed to have been her grave. In 2015, the corpse was found at the site.
The skeletons found in the caves are estimated to be over 40

2024-09-25 03:19:42,010 - Generated text:  a soldier.
British soldier Simon Parker penned the poignant letter to his wife, Sam, from an Afghan base in 2009. At the time, he was working with a brigade of soldiers, inspecting the harvest in Kajaki, a town in the Helmand Province.
“Sam, I’m feeling good. I’m so proud of what we’re doing,” the letter reads. “I get up in the morning and I want to go to work.”
Sam and her daughter Aaliyah, now 11, have made their way to Afghanistan this week. The two are traveling from their home in Portsmouth, England, to visit Simon in the Kajaki area.
“It’s a very emotional trip for her,” Sam told WION.
WION's Ranjit Bhatia caught up with her in the heart of Kabul city, where the two are spending a few days to take in the local culture.
“I am very much looking forward to meeting Simon, our daughter and the children from the areas we have been stationed,” she said.
In the letter, Sam reveals that Simon doesn’t want her to visit him for the trip. In fact, he has been warning her against the trip all along, calling it a “trip from hell.”
The trip has taken on new significance for the mother as she is coming with her daughter to celebrate her 11th birthday.
Sam’s 11-year-old daughter Aaliyah has been learning about the trials her father has faced in the country and is looking forward to her trip.
“She has a lot of respect for him,” said Sam.
When asked how she feels about spending time with her father, Aaliyah simply replied, “She loves me very much.”
Aaliyah is also getting a special opportunity to meet the soldier she has seen so often on television. She was particularly excited to be travelling to Afghanistan to meet her father, a 30-year-old British soldier.
When WION spoke to the mother, she said her daughter had written her a letter telling her that she was very excited to meet her father.
“I have seen Simon and Aaliyah together, but I have never had the opportunity to meet him,” said Sam.
The mother and daughter plan to visit Simon on October 29 and will be in Kabul for one day before going on to Kajaki.
Sam said she would like to be at the airport to greet her daughter.
"The trip will be amazing for our daughter, who I know is very excited to meet her father,” said Sam. “This is a great experience for her.”
The mother of the soldier said the trip was going to be challenging, but that she was confident she could make it to Kajaki.
“My daughter is in high school and I know that she is more than capable of making the trip,” said Sam. “We are not scared of our own country. We will see if there is any danger. We will meet and I will try to keep a good distance.”
As for Simon, he is also excited to meet his daughter.
“I hope Aaliyah will find her father and be able to meet him,” said Sam.

When famed archaeologist Vasile Iorga—lost in space, en route to the "Endurance," the world's most advanced planetary survey vessel—emerges from hypersleep, it is two decades since he has seen a human. As a communications hub for the diverse beings of the galactic community, the "Endurance" harbors an all-star crew of many worlds and species. But one of the sentient creatures onboard has designs on the ship itself—and on the mysterious object Vasile unearthed in space. It is an object that the galactic community has long-since given up hope of ever finding. Now, as Vasile clashes with the "Endurance's" eclectic crew, an alien intelligence is rising . . . and Vasile holds the key to humanity's salvation or doom.
Hugo Award nominee Allen M. Steele, author of the critically acclaimed Arkwright series, once again explores a universe of wonders that is both a beacon of hope and a perilous frontier.
"Echoing many classic themes in science fiction, as well as some familiar plot elements, Shattered Shield is nonetheless a work that manages to stand on its own . . . an excellent read that can stand as an introduction to Steele's work."
—SF Revu
Shattered Shield 3.8 out of 5 based on 0 ratings. 4 reviews.
Loved this book! The characters are the true stars. Even though they are part of an advanced and completely alien culture, I felt that I could relate to each one of them. It was easy to care what happened to each of them. When I started the book, I thought I was reading a re-telling of a similar space story but ended up really liking the characters and story.
I picked up this book looking for an adventure sci-fi read and this book has done not disappoint. I am really enjoying the characters and learning about this Galaxy. I can't wait to see where this author takes us next
Allen Steele has been one of my favorite authors for many years. I really liked this one. I enjoy a different type of character driven novel, but not this far into the future. I have read that some readers are disappointed with this book. My recommendation is to take the book for what it is, and enjoy it. Don't expect to be thrilled by some extraordianry event or plot. This is more about people than it is about technology, and Steele has done a great job with that. A pleasant surprise!
EmrysR Reviews More than 1 year ago
I really enjoyed this book, it was nicely paced and the characters were interesting and really developed through the novel. There were no gaping plot holes and very little "you've got to be kidding me!" moments. The world the author has created is full and well thought out. It felt well planned and was clearly the product of many hours of thought and research. Highly recommended for science fiction fans.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,011 - Generated text:  crashing cars or fainting in a crowd. The international investigative news organization ProPublica has been digging into the app and has found links between it and one of the most powerful lobbying firms in Washington.
For some people, a request for a good school comes in the form of a white spot that appears in their vision. For others, an image of an envelope materializes on their phone screens. Some people ask for specific times and dates and use code words when talking to friends and family about what's going on.
It's not entirely clear who is behind the app, which was released in 2019 and is named "Wish" for privacy purposes.
A ProPublica report found that the app's owners, a Florida-based company called Wish, were linked to K Street, the Washington D.C. area known for its politically connected lobbying firms. The company is affiliated with Cogent Group, a D.C.-based firm that was founded by lobbyist Brian Ballard and an affiliate of McGuireWoods Consulting.
When ProPublica approached Wish with questions about the app and its connection to McGuireWoods, Wish said it didn't make the app. But a McGuireWoods email on its behalf to a Wish reporter says it "assisted" in developing the app, and it asked the reporter to delete their response after they gave it a thumbs-up. ProPublica's investigation concluded that Wish created the app, and it received feedback and ideas from McGuireWoods.
More from ProPublica:
“For decades, K Street firms have tried to get around lobbying rules and sometimes bribed politicians by setting up nonprofit groups that are not subject to disclosure. The app, according to interviews with a dozen people who know it, is an extension of that strategy. It was a soft-power push to get people to buy into a vision of the future they helped design.”
Members of Congress say they don't know anything about the app. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, said she didn't know about the app and had concerns. Republican Senator Ron Johnson said he thinks the app is harmless.
"If you can't identify who's behind it, what the goal is, I have no issue with the idea that you can get an envelope or something showing up on your cellphone, but I'm not about to put my name on it," he said.
The app has become more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's unclear how many people are using it.
Though Wish claims that it's harmless, concerns about data privacy are one reason why some people are spooked. The company hasn't answered questions about how it collects data or sells it to advertisers, and it hasn't revealed how it filters the wishes.
Additionally, people who have taken the app's quiz report getting information in their Wish feeds that seems to align with their wish. This has raised alarms about how the company is using the personal information it has collected.

She could feel the wall of the stage. She could see the ropes hanging from the rigging. She imagined the curtains opening and the beautiful woman from the poster walking down the center aisle, her eyes seeking the audience.
Tessa stopped at the front door and tried the handle. Locked, of course. So much the better. The keys were in her pocket. She used them to unlock the door, entered the lobby and turned on the lights. She walked past the poster hanging from the wall, examining its bold claim: All The Right Moves Coming Soon.
The lobby was marble and glass and red velvet and crystal. Tessa walked toward the stairs, remembering the darkened auditorium she'd seen from her window. She wandered around the theater, walking slowly past the seats to the farthest corner. When she looked to her left, she saw a narrow passageway, the space between the wall and the tiered rows of seats, the pathway to the stage. She followed it to the end, then stood at the bottom of the stairs and climbed them.
She walked onto the stage. It was surprisingly large, probably a proscenium of some size, but that was all she could tell because there was no curtain. What she could see was the chandelier, hanging to one side, where the stage had been built out into the audience. She sat in a chair that had been left on the stage, closed her eyes and imagined the lights brightening and the woman's face in front of her.
But it was only the theater. She had wanted it to be so much more.
Tessa wandered back to the lobby, walked past the stage door and outside. She started down the hill, back to her lonely apartment. She was tired and feeling down. Tessa hadn't been happy about moving to Los Angeles in the first place, and then the nightmare of real estate negotiations had left her emotionally raw. A few days later, she'd wandered up to the abandoned theater, started wondering about it and found herself back in the house she'd been living in while writing the next big novel.
She closed the front door behind her. As she walked to the kitchen, Tessa realized she had just lived through the same emotional roller coaster of life events she had every morning of her four-year stint in Los Angeles. She had come here as an out of work screenwriter in a town filled with hopeful writers looking for the break that would make them the next Stephen King, and she had moved into the little house because it had been cheap.
As she stood at the counter, she poured a glass of ice water from the fridge and drank it. It was the same thing she did every morning.
"Shit," she said to herself. "I've got to get out of here."
Tessa woke in the middle of the night, out of bed. She sat in her chair, looking at the empty wall. She thought about that abandoned theater. She thought about the chandelier and the curtains and the lobby. She was in L.A., but she wasn't really there. She missed him so much she ached.
Tessa stepped through the doorway of her apartment, looked down the block, then turned the corner and headed toward the theater. It was like a dream, really. A dream that brought her comfort. A dream that filled her heart with the pain of longing.
She looked at the lighted windows, but she saw no sign of life. Maybe they'd abandoned the place already. Maybe the dream would be a little easier to put aside now. Maybe this time she'd wake up and the dream would be gone.
Tessa stepped through the door, walked to the staircase and went down. She reached the theater floor and walked across the lobby, toward the passageway. She started down the aisle and turned the corner. The curtains were still pulled, blocking her view of the stage, but the chandelier hanging to the side was still bright.
She heard music. Soft. Ethereal. It was playing through the wall. She stepped through the doors to the balcony, followed the sound and came to the dressing room, where a recording of a violinist practicing was filling the room. She pushed the door open. It swung against the hinges, its weight offended. She stopped

2024-09-25 03:19:42,011 - Generated text:  Sophie’s past and future in this utterly charming historical romance set in the south of France.
Following the unexpected death of her husband, Sophie Giraud moves into his childhood home in the south of France to help raise her young children. She has recently discovered that her mother-in-law is a Holocaust survivor and is dealing with a painful secret that has emerged in the wake of her husband’s passing.
She is now haunted by the decision she made 27 years ago, one she has always regretted. But fate brings her into contact with an old friend from her youth and from the village, Max Leblanc, who is suffering with heart problems. Together, they grow closer and rediscover a flame that never quite went out. But there is a cloud on the horizon, in the form of Max’s mother, an aunt, and a son, all of whom object to Max’s involvement with a Giraud. And what will Sophie do when she learns that the house she lives in is not her legal property?
I can only find one quote that mentions Christmas so far, but since Sophie (the heroine) mentions that her mother-in-law is Jewish, it is implied that they don’t celebrate it.
Cleanliness: Sophie doesn’t like going without her makeup, so she is probably make-up free. She also doesn’t like doing a lot of housework (it’s her daughter’s job now), but she makes a point of cleaning up the kitchen after each meal.
Mental health: Sophie is depressed.
Physical health: She is apparently of sound health (the story doesn’t mention illnesses or medications).

The whole “The Holocaust survivor is your mother-in-law” thing really throws the story into a dark place, when I expected to be reading an amusing light-hearted historical romance…
I guess we will see where that goes, as I was disappointed that I didn’t find much Christmas cheer to share. 🙂
I have had better experiences with French historical romances than most of the English ones. I will try this one too, maybe.
I was pretty disappointed with this one, and I don’t think I will be buying the sequel that just came out.
Yeah, this book sounds very good!

Excellent review, Jessica. Thank you for taking the time to share with us. I will add this book to my TBR list.
Naturally, you are very welcome, Linda. 🙂
Thank you for your review, Jessica. It’s a good thing that some people still care about this old genre. In my opinion, it does not exist anymore since the advent of the Internet and social media. People will get their feelings from the images and the presentations which just reflect the author’s imagination. I am not against this evolution, but as a reader I mourn the loss of those lovely books that transport us to a time and place I can only dream about.
It’s true, the world of publishing has definitely changed over the years. I do sometimes wonder if a good number of “old” romance readers who would rather stick to the newer, more modern and steamier books would enjoy a bit of a break from all that if they were willing to go back and read a few of the classics. I certainly enjoyed them, but I know some people think of them as boring and dated.
I’m not crazy about historical romances in general, but I was wondering how these dealt with the SAT. This one sounds particularly grim. I remember reading something by Stephanie Laurens where the characters discussed the Holocaust in a general way. Maybe in historical fiction this is acceptable. I’d like to read something where the SAT isn’t the only thing in the characters’ minds. The Kindle version of this is only 99 cents. But it doesn’t sound like the best investment of a dollar

Reagan Heller has been blind since birth. But when a new experimental surgery restores her sight, Reagan is faced with a vision that gives her more fear than she'd ever imagined. For while Reagan has been blind, Ophelia's world has been in black and white. Their worlds collide in an unforgettable cataclysm of darkness and light.
Could a person know too much?
This rich, genre-bending work fuses science fiction with a mainstream thriller to stunning effect. Combining heart-in-mouth suspense with a mind-boggling, passionate love story, ARMADA is pure Cline. For fans of authors like Ernest Cline, Hugh Howey, Margaret Atwood, Ray Bradbury, and Margaret Drabble.

I loved the concept.
My boyfriend and I listened to this book as a road trip and both of us enjoyed it. In fact, we decided to listen to another Crouch book after finishing this one. I really liked the blend of science and religious elements in this book. The scientific elements were well thought out and well presented in the story. There were two parts of the story I didn’t enjoy: The love triangle, and the story of aliens vs. God. The story of aliens vs. God felt extraneous to me and not entirely necessary. I also disliked the idea that if people didn’t believe in God that they weren’t saved. That is an extremely dated and arrogant view that has no place in modern society. That being said, there are a few very thought provoking messages in this book that left me considering the story well after finishing it. In that respect I loved this book. It made me think. That is not always easy to find in science fiction novels. The ending was a bit of a let down in some ways. There were a few plot points left unresolved. However, as I said above, this book was more about the thought provoking questions that this novel brought to mind than the story itself.
Great plot & terrific characters. Kept my attention until the end.
What did you love best about Dark Matter?
What other book might you compare Dark Matter to and why?
It's like 40ish% science fiction, and 60ish% a romantic comedy with a sci-fi edge. And then you add a lot of profound philosophy, and put a little cosmic horror in there, and you get Dark Matter. I'd definitely compare it to Ready Player One in that both are deftly mixed genres and almost impossible to compare to any other books.
What does Vikas Adam, Johnny Heller, Jesse Bernstein and MacLeod Andrews bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?
Their narrators were amazing. You can tell they're pros, and it was a really fun listening experience.
The author writes so well. There were a few times when I had to stop reading to put in some more hours of sleep because I just couldn't go to sleep without finding out what happened next. And, for me, that's a sign of a great book.
Beware of endless pages of awful religious views
What disappointed you about Dark Matter?
This is an interesting premise, and I was hoping for a great story, but it became clear

As cemeteries go, it is certainly one of the most haunted.
Old City Cemetery is home to the graves of one of Missouri’s most beloved figures, as well as other influential citizens. Once known as the Garden of Eden for its beautiful trees, serene grounds, and Victorian-era mausoleums, the cemetery’s image was tarnished by a brutal killing in 1896, and since then, tourists have shunned it.
But when it comes to solving a crime, Josie Barrett, the most reclusive member of the cemetery’s reopened society, has the information they seek. She simply needs to convince her reluctant great-great-grandson, law professor Gabriel Raintree, to share it.
Gabriel, concerned about Josie’s well-being, hires a young police detective to investigate what he suspects is a criminal prank. But the detective, Cody Austin, and Gabriel soon find themselves drawn into a web of family secrets, including a cryptic recipe handed down from one generation to the next—a recipe that could lead to the killer’s doorstep.
Katherine holds a Master of Arts in Writing from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing and Biology from Furman University, in Greenville, South Carolina. When she isn’t writing, she can be found on a local golf course, where she tends to her husband’s handicap and offers unsolicited—but well-intentioned—playing advice. Kate’s novels include A Criminal, Not a Gentleman (2014) and A Questionable Client (2015), which were published in hardcover and ebook by Berkley Prime Crime. A Killer Retreat, the first book in her new Lady of Ashes mystery series, will be published by Alibi in January 2016. Katherine is represented by Courtney Miller-Callihan of Handspun Literary.
P.S. Thanks to Katherine for a fabulous excerpt. I loved the short story. I’m really looking forward to her new mystery series!

2024-09-25 03:19:42,011 - Generated text:  a twist in the mystery.
With an eager search for the perfect, holiday gift, the nation uncovers a long-forgotten talent.
In a display of favoritism and cold ambition, a town battles inward for its safety.
At a whim, like a child, the wise speak of life and death, and nature follows.
Revelations spark wildfires as truth collides with false-pretence.
For those who wish to indulge in this centuries old phenomenon, a good book is all you need. These are but a few tales of the world.
Other Worlds will be launched in bookstores and all other available outlets in December 2013.
* Note: “Vigil” is a short story from which one of the stories in Other Worlds is adapted. It was previously published in Mythic, A Collection of Short Stories and Tales, released in November 2012.
Excited for this one, m’yah!
In every line of the manuscript, a character waved from every side, every page – and I wanted them all. If I were in a position to choose, I’d adopt these books as my own.
When I received the manuscript, I was struck by its unmistakable quality of an original classic.
The collection boasts of a wide range of themes, including childhood, greed, friendship, love, fate and even a historical lesson, all united by a shared love of language and art.
In all, an exemplary work.
I’ve never met a set of friends who found me through their worlds, like Oluwaseun did, but through his poems, I came to meet them.
I found myself reading through them, each a time, slowly – at first, mesmerized.
It was as if my fingers had come to know the streets of their world, in their pulse, as I passed through them, allowing them to mold me.
From all these conversations, I learnt of memories we have, and dreams we all hold dear.
My favourite of them all, however, is Every Tiny Thing and Hour, a collection of sonnets, an honest, observational account of our day to day lives.
These poems vividly reminded me of the dreams I once held dear, and they certainly did.
Amazingly well-written, and I’m so excited to read the whole collection.
A love for this story that I couldn’t help but carry around with me.
In Rae Odedina’s Retellings, I found a collection of wonderfully woven tales – stories about stories, and stories about storytellers, mostly in the tradition of fantastical, mythical Nigeria.
My favourite is Exile, a story of forbidden love and danger. It tells of our belief in stories, about the power we see in them, to alter our destinies.
And the threat of the nightmare.
This is a wonderful collection.
I should really stop reading so many short story collections.
Anyways, Mixed Up by Chika Jones is one I was wary of. I mean, I’d gotten to read her hauntingly spine-tingling collection, Sanguine, so I was looking forward to her works.
It was always her poems I came for.
But then, she just seemed to write prose, and good one, too.
Because this was a well-written collection. I love the little twists, and the themes of each short story.
Favourite of them all is The Gift, a tale of justice.
This collection is one that’s inspired by Nigeria.
I love that. I’m a huge fan of Nigerian stories, I am.
But these stories do not dwell on our pains and agonies – the Nigerian maids (baby makers) who hold up our homes, or the crimes of a society of the young, or the woes of the mother who must feed her children.
But they celebrate.
And, they have just the kind of Nigeria I love.
There is a darkened edge, a plot that leaves you wanting more, the wicked witches and capricious gods that haunt our tales.
Mixed with the magic, and the trickery, and the hope and despair and heroism.
A truly, wonderfully Nigerian collection.
Here are the websites of the wonderful authors I’ve been privileged to encounter, here, through their works.

Wyrmkin
Sam did not know what he was walking into when he agreed to go to the library to help out with their forensic anthropology internship. That was because the library was not a library in the conventional sense of the word. It was the building, the structure, the place that the Worden family had set up to house all their vampire artifacts, cryptic texts, and occult relics.
Even in the darkest winter night, she could feel the heat and hear the roar of the furnace. The coal-powered heater was an old rusted skeleton cage with a tangled nest of pipes running along the floor, reaching up into the walls. The hot air came from a dozen holes, where black dust spewed forth from the rusty grilles. The heat filled the house, roasting the cinder block walls and warming her toes against the cold, hard floor. The walls were baking with warmth, and she felt as if she could feel the weight of it against her cheek.
Sam couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this warm and relaxed. He’d been on the road now for a couple of days. His hat, with the missing brim, still smelled of sweat. As he made his way through the middle of nowhere, he’d passed dozens of truck stops. Each one, big and neon bright, enticing him to pull off the highway and stop for the night. He knew he had to press on. If he didn’t, the droning monotony of the road would drive him mad.
Not That Way Home
I asked my dad, “Can you tell me the way home?” He said, “No, my love. You can’t be home now. You’ve got so much to do before you can get there. And if I give you directions, then you’ll think I don’t trust you, and that’s the last thing I want to do.”
Rebel Tattooist
How do you shatter the invincible? Our greatest heroes are truly human, they just manage to be so through thousands of years. When we look at their histories, we see that the heroes have often faltered and felt the pain, and worse, made the mistake of giving it to others.
The Lie I Tell
The woman came back again to the bed. She sat down, cross-legged, so she was right at the bed’s foot. The man lay, still and silent, his wound heavily bandaged, the skin of his side taut with pain. The woman gripped her dagger tightly, and he could hear it rasp and slip against the blade. She was silent now, her face tight and stern, dagger gripped firmly in her fist.

After two decades away, Donald feels like a stranger in his own house and has to settle in to a new existence, filled with memories of the past and a sense of what he has lost. Alone on the island, he nevertheless feels safe; safe from the memories and regrets he has left behind, and safe from being alone. However, when a family of troubled refugees arrive on the shore, Donald is forced to confront his own past and his relationships with his children, as well as facing up to his own prejudices and opinions of people who are, like him, refugees. A beautifully written story of a man who must relearn how to love again, and who will come to value the little kitten he finds on his journey, that has, like himself, found a home among strangers. A haunting, tender and deeply moving story of the way we are brought together by what seems like chance, only to discover that fate is always at work, giving us a chance to remake ourselves for the better.

The 650-square-foot kitchen garden is a magnificent mess of early spring growth and bloom. After the first snowstorm of the year, the tender green of the first sprouting lettuce leaves glistens like jewels among the gray lashings of snow. In the back corner of the garden, the borage thrives in the mud under the snow, its cucumber-blue flowers producing the nutritious edible flowers. The garden is completely indifferent to the chilly early spring nights, the growth continuing through the frigid evening, beneath the cozy glow of my floating lights.
As spring advances, the back of the kitchen garden is filled with the happy croakings of my new pond. After a week of snow, rain, and sleet, the pond quickly came to life and filled with spring green duckweed. The ever-present mallards visit the pond almost daily, coming to shore to nestle themselves in the warmth of the afternoon sun, and have been known to spend time in the water on some very pleasant spring evenings. A catfish just under a foot long comes to visit, and always comes to the same spot to nestle his head against the upper edge of the pot and rest.
The potatoes are now the size of softballs and just starting to break through the soil. The chives have pushed past the snow line, and this morning the first asparagus shoots emerged. The rhubarb roots are all as thick and juicy as babies’ thighs, waiting for a sign from the sun to begin growth. And in the butter lettuce bed, the first head of butter lettuce is the first sign of the new growth to come.
But for me, the kitchen garden is always a reminder of the harvest to come. In the same spot as the lettuce are cabbage plants that will be the mainstay of my winter stock. There is collard, turnip, Swiss chard, and kale, all of which will live and feed for me throughout the winter. There are also the traditional winter squash, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes, which I will harvest and store, so that I can provide my family with a bit of a taste of the harvest year-round.
The kitchen garden is a little oasis of growth and spring for my family, and its bounty is celebrated daily in recipes throughout the year. The living ecosystems of the garden remind us to seek and protect this habitat for all.

Necessity of the Garden
The journey of an urban farmer is an inevitable one. When one realizes that the individual that they are buying food from has no idea where the food comes from, that’s when an idea is born.
The Garden at The Office.
The Office: My first job out of college, a cushy job with a fantastic benefits package, was working in a commercial greenhouse. A wonderful education with a very narrow outlook on farming. The education in growing flowering crops, herbs, and exotic fruits was fascinating and laid a great foundation for what I know today. The narrow outlook of commercial agriculture is what led me to the greenhouse job to begin with. After a year, I was one of the few that were terminated in a huge cutback of the greenhouse. At first I was upset, but I was encouraged by the owner who suggested that I might like farming. And I did like it! So, this layoff was a great opportunity for me. As a crop scientist with a “specialization” in vegetables, it was a great fit. I put all my belongings in the trunk of my car and drove away. This was just in time for the 1996 drought in the Midwest. No jobs were available anywhere. But, I was lucky enough to spend some time on a friend’s farm in central California working with vegetables.

Such a great idea! I've been trying to create a new fashion event in my city that revolves around recycling. I know its tough, but if you would have enough time to email me back and tell me how you started it and what was your biggest challenge I would greatly appreciate it! I'm making a dress out of plastic bags, yogurt containers and aluminum cans. I would love to hear how I can expand the project.
Taryn March 28, 2014 @ 18:07
These ideas are so amazing and creative and the results are amazing as well. I am currently writing a paper on this for one of my classes, I have contacted the Red Tent and asked to speak with someone about this event. I have not heard back from them yet but if you have the time could you contact me and we could speak about the planning of the event? I will email you as well for the live feed of the event.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,012 - Prompt 118: The discovery of a rare species in the Amazon rainforest opens up discussions about
2024-09-25 03:19:42,012 - Generated text:  the importance of preserving species of high conservation interest and the value of ex situ conservation.
Describing a species for the first time in its natural habitat is a remarkable experience for anyone doing scientific research. This year in the central part of the Brazilian Amazon, Brazilian botanist Igor Carvalho do Amaral and his colleagues are likely to have experienced just that after discovering a previously unknown orchid species of the genus Miltoniopsis (family Orchidaceae).
Among the Amazon’s 40,000 orchid species, only 12 species of the Miltoniopsis genus have ever been documented, and the finding of a 13th species highlights the incredible richness of this area of the Amazon.
Igor, a biologist with expertise in Amazonian orchids, recently discovered the species in the Euterpea River basin, in the municipality of Loreto, which is one of the largest hydrographic basins of the central Amazon. This discovery also presents an interesting opportunity to think about the value of plant ex situ conservation, since the specimen of Miltoniopsis has been maintained and grown for over 30 years in a botanical garden in the city of Manaus, capital of the Amazon state of Amazonas.
“What is valuable in botanical gardens is not just to grow plants, but also to research them and to manage them properly”, says Luís I. Moreira of São Paulo State University (UNESP) and coordinator of the Amazon Orchid Network. “Botanical gardens are vital for ex situ plant conservation. In fact, an ex situ species is one that has already been removed from its natural habitat and its survival depends on ex situ conservation”, he says.
From discoveries to conservation
Focused on Brazilian species of high conservation interest, Luís founded the Amazon Orchid Network 25 years ago. This network brings together orchid researchers and plant enthusiasts who share the same goal: to contribute to the conservation of these plants.
Since its establishment, the network has identified 300 orchid species (some of which are considered endangered), of which 16 are Brazilian species endemic to the Amazon. The new species of Miltoniopsis found in the Amazon was added to the list of the network’s endemic species.
“We began the network in 1995 as a way to bring together Brazilian botanists interested in these species. Our goal was to study and identify these species, to know where they are found, and to decide how they could be conserved. Our concern was not only to identify species but also to ensure that their habitats and genetic diversity were conserved”, says Luís, who teaches in the postgraduate program in Biodiversity at UNESP and is an associate professor at the Postgraduate Program in Biodiversity and Restoration Ecology at the Federal University of Pará (UFPA).
The Amazon Orchid Network aims to encourage the discovery and research of Amazonian orchids. Of the 40,000 orchid species in the world, more than 10% are found in this part of Brazil. However, most of these species are already threatened and at risk of extinction. “The main threat to these plants is fragmentation of the Amazonian forest due to human activities, such as mining and agriculture. The main species in the Amazon are vulnerable, endangered, or at risk of extinction”, warns Luís.
For ex situ conservation, the network also relies on partnerships with botanical gardens in Brazil and abroad. An example of these partnerships is a project called SPREPBIRD (Species Preservation Research and Ex situ Plant Conservation through Botanical Gardens), which is coordinated by Luís and financed by the São Paulo Research Foundation – FAPESP. The objective of the project is to ensure the ex situ conservation of 25 Amazonian orchid species endemic to the Brazilian Amazon in Brazilian botanical gardens. So far, 14 species have been included in the project, including the Miltoniopsis species found by Igor.
The Amazon Orchid Network also works to identify and monitor populations of the same species in their natural habitats. This work involves generating a list of localities (sites or places) for each species and the presence of natural populations. This information is important for prioritizing species for conservation. It also helps to manage the conservation status of these species.
Orchids at risk
The family Orchidaceae includes 23,000 species distributed in tropical regions around the world. Of these, approximately 1200 are found in the Amazon, which accounts for 6% of

Is Donald Trump the American Barack Obama?
When Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, Americans feared for the worst. One year later, in 1982, they could not believe how wonderful things had turned out. “Liberalism is so 1979,” was one of the many amazing slogans of the Reagan era. How was this miraculous turn of events accomplished? I like to believe that Reagan’s “Evil Empire” speech in West Berlin helped Americans rally around their president as he helped turn the American ship around.
President Donald Trump, like Reagan, enjoys certain advantages over his predecessor, one of which is the intense hostility of the Left, which is not beholden to democracy.
In 2016, the American voters, by dint of their long suffering at the hands of a high-handed, contemptuous elite, elected an unapologetic nationalist, albeit with his eyes on America, with no awareness or interest in global affairs. They elected him in a landmark upset, one which has been thrown out of balance for the progressives.
To the elites of the Left, this was a crime and blasphemy. It was not just a White House candidate who was anti-globalization; he was outright anti-globalization. Not only that, his foreign policy views and rhetoric were outright provocative, rude, and uncouth. They were “unacceptable” in that unacceptable was now a regular feature of the American lexicon, thanks to the 2016 elections. Unlike those who warned that America was not a great nation, but was really a “rotten apple” and “racist and sexist,” this was a genuine unacceptable.
After the 2016 elections, one could hardly blame anyone for being overwhelmed by the series of catastrophes that befelled our nationalist president. Even Trump’s enemies, who fought like tigers to derail his agenda, cannot point to a single great success since his victory in November 2016. Every initiative, including health care, jobs, taxes, trade, and peace, has failed miserably. Instead, the president, his supporters, and the country have experienced a 500-day long horror show, with the mainstream media playing as its cheerleaders.
At every step of the way, a committed minority of American voters have refused to yield to these nationalist pretensions. This unyielding minority of those who loved our freedom has contributed significantly to the widespread dissatisfaction among the general public. The Democrats could not invade us at the ballot box; they could not win us over through negotiations or compromise, and they could not subjugate us through intimidation, riots, violence, and death threats. They had to resort to a military coup.
Trump, the unreconstructed American nationalist, became a target for assassination, which his political enemies and the media shared and helped by reporting that a crazed fanatic had tried to shoot him on the afternoon of May 20. That is a very serious claim, one which I have not seen a single newspaper or wire agency bother to investigate. It is almost unprecedented in a country where some 30,000 people are killed by firearms every year. That seems like a lot to me. But the MSM and the Democrats alike didn’t care: they simply reported the story as if it were true, and they still do.
And now the American people have seen what they thought was a peaceful protest degenerate into an angry rampage that even included smashing windows and punching out police officers. They have seen liberal supporters of the president, including students who came to the White House with black masks covering their faces, attacking

There are some weather modification projects, including cloud seeding and ozone layer treatments, but these only affect specific spots. For example, China does cloud seeding in parts of the country, which results in Beijing receiving 66% less rainfall and more rain elsewhere.
“This report provides an assessment of the environmental and social impacts of weather modification and the technologies associated with it, with an emphasis on atmospheric aerosol geoengineering. Research into this technology has been accelerating in recent years, and as a result, there are only a few gaps in the literature concerning the impacts of the deployment of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering. However, many more gaps exist in relation to large-scale weather modification efforts using conventional methods. Further research is therefore needed to better understand these consequences.”
“We must always keep in mind that as a result of the many beneficial effects of weather modification, many other changes may also occur in our world. Many people may not like the changes which they feel will negatively affect their daily lives. It is better to fully understand, evaluate, and anticipate all changes, so that the environment can be better managed for the future. In some cases, these changes may occur because of the greater natural variability in our world, due to global warming, or they may be due to weather modification.”

Can engineered volcanoes solve the carbon problem?
Volcanoes can remove excess carbon from the atmosphere, but they also emit greenhouse gases. So if we want to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere to help solve the global warming problem, we should learn from them.
Volcanoes and craters
Most volcanoes have formed from lava flow, and this lava is mostly molten rock (like solidified magma). This liquid rock is basaltic, so it is dark in colour. When the lava solidifies, the basalt (the dark rock) remains on top of the softer rock, which is usually in the form of ash or pumice. So most volcanoes have a layer of basalt on the surface, as well as many craters from the lava that erupted out in previous eruptions.
The lava that erupts out of a volcano contains all of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. So when it erupts, it removes greenhouse gases (like CO2 and methane) from the atmosphere. This is why it is estimated that volcanoes remove 100-400 gigatons (or billion tons) of CO2 from the atmosphere each year. However, volcanoes also emit about 1.5 to 4.5 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year, which can cause volcanic winters.
Volcanic winters occur when the ash and soot released by a volcanic eruption into the atmosphere blocks out the sun's rays. This is often mistaken as a case of the world getting colder, but it doesn't. This phenomenon, which causes volcanic winters, is a result of what happens when the ash blocks out the sun's rays. As it reflects more solar energy, the planet actually gets hotter. And the more ash and soot in the atmosphere, the hotter it gets.
If more carbon is released into the atmosphere than can be removed from the atmosphere by volcanoes, then climate change will continue.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,013 - Generated text:  renewables, and an impressive and promising step to protect the earth’s climate and global biodiversity, according to an article co-authored by Hess professor Dr. Christof Wöll. The article is published in Nature Energy and written by a group of 25 scientists from 12 countries.
“The conversion of biomass to liquid hydrocarbons has long been regarded as an unattractive strategy for renewable transport fuel because of the limited efficiency of the competing biological and thermal conversion processes,” says Wöll, Professor of Applied Thermochemistry at TU Darmstadt. “Recent breakthroughs in catalysis promise to drastically reduce the production costs of biomass-derived biofuels in the future.”
In their article, the authors present the results of a comprehensive analysis of the current literature and provide new scenarios on the future potential of the emerging technology of catalytic pyrolysis for the efficient conversion of biomass into bio-based fuels and chemicals.
“Our analysis shows that the future conversion of biomass into fuel and chemicals through catalytic pyrolysis could meet almost 50% of the European demand for fossil fuels in the year 2050, simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions by half compared to current production levels,” Wöll says.
The authors conclude that if this approach continues to advance as anticipated, there is a need to develop strategies to manage biomass demand in order to reduce pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems.
“Ecosystems must be protected from unsustainable intensification in order to avoid adverse impacts on biodiversity,” says Wöll. “Besides increasing the yield and quality of crops, developing more resource-efficient fertilizers, and increasing the efficiency of the bioconversion processes, strategies to further reduce the overall use of agricultural land would be crucial.”
The article has been published in the October issue of Nature Energy.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,013 - Generated text:  the beauty of the scene in a stroke of his brush. With the essence of his brush strokes, he re-creates a scene on the canvas, but only when he adds the brushstrokes in such a way as to capture the splendor of the actual ocean scene, does the painting reveal its true beauty. Similarly, Nirmala Guru Granth and Guru Nanak Dev Ji are the strokes that God has painted on the canvas of humanity, and a saint is the brush that has mastered the art of brushstrokes. Such a master takes the blessed gift of the Shabad and paints it on the canvas of his mind and the canvas of his speech. He captures its beauty. However, when one endeavours to paint a picture of the Shabad but falls short of capturing the essence of the original, it reveals the shortcomings of the brushstroke. A master only captures the true essence of the Guru’s words by using the brushstrokes that He Himself has revealed. Inspired by the Guru, a soul gains His true Shabad, and becomes the living and breathing brush for the Creator, the Master.
A devotee should ask himself: is his life a hymn to God or merely a petty poem with lowly syllables?
Truth has no form. Do not worship form.
I am a devotee of Hari and shall live in heaven, My soul to Hari always dedicated.
My desire is to be associated with the devotees of the Lord; my sadhana is to meet the devotees of the Lord.
The devotee who says nothing – what does he say? God understands that he has made the necessary sacrifices.
If you keep company with God, you will obtain His glory.
The devotee who lives his life in accordance with the Lord is a devotee of the Lord.
A devotee of the Lord has no other work.
If you want to know the true condition of the soul, the devotee who is attached to God is the true reflection.
He who searches for his own self becomes the True Self.
The essence of Truth is: the Truth is the Truth, the Truth is real and everlasting, the Truth is not transitory.
How should we treat those devotees of the Lord who think they have become Guru and God? One should simply continue to go towards the Guru.
For the devotee, Meher-Guru is always in front and behind.
For a devotee who does not desire God, how can he long for His Love?
A devotee who does not recognize the state of ecstasy is like a demon in human form.
There is no devotee more sacred than one whose body is filled with the intoxication of the Name.
A devotee who works at will, leaving aside the task at hand and becoming engrossed in meditation, is inconstant and doubtful.
The devotee who lives a life of intoxication and ecstasy and only knows happiness is a truly blessed soul.
If you want to be a saint, first be a devotee.
Through the devotion of the body, the soul gains access to the Lord.
One who only seeks to be with devotees of the Lord is a true devotee of the Lord.
When you are like a devotee of the Lord, God’s true devotees will be drawn to you.
All you need to do is the work of a devotee, and then God will do all the rest.
Be the devotee of the Lord; you will gain the Supreme Lord.
You yourself are the devotee of the Lord.
The body may be unsteady, but the devotee who is enlightened by the Shabad is not unsteady.
A devotee of the Lord, in spite of his age, is immortal.
The Lord loves devotees; devotees love the Lord.
Both devotees and Guru are true devotees of the Lord.
When the devotee attains his destiny, the Guru also attains his destiny.
A devotee who is devoted to his destiny and only recites God’s Name will surely attain God.
A true devotee is the embodiment of the Lord.
When the devotee who recites the Lord’s Name within is intoxicated, he is absorbed in ecstasy.
By loving the devotee of the Lord, we gain the devotion

2024-09-25 03:19:42,013 - Generated text:  which kind of hero they like best. Finding a real superhero is just as contentious, but Emi knows which side of the debate she's on.
Emi rushes to catch the last bus back from a late night babysitting job, but the bus breaks down. She’s stranded in the snow-covered rural countryside. She’s wet. She’s exhausted. And she’s alone.
When Emi is in trouble, Tova comes to her rescue. She appears out of thin air as if she is indeed a superhero. But the solution is a little more mundane: Tova is actually a girl in a wheelchair, living on the farm next to Emi’s house.
Emi offers Tova a ride home, but Tova has an ulterior motive. She wants Emi to join the local superhero club.
In some ways, the club is exactly what Emi would expect. It’s made up of typical comic book superheroes like Superman and Wonder Woman. But some of the members are a little more unexpected: a drunk young man who thinks he’s a superhero and an older man who is utterly convinced that he’s a vampire.
If the club is off-beat, then Tova is even stranger. She is obsessed with comic book superheroes and in particular, with Marvel’s Thor, a superhero who always seems to be getting into scrapes with evil villains. She wants Emi to help her complete a Thor-related mural she’s been painting, because she believes Thor’s signature must be present. Emi thinks it’s bizarre, but she’s also drawn to Tova.
At first, Emi feels awkward and out-of-place in the club. But, as the club works together to solve a mystery, Emi learns to loosen up, makes new friends and falls in love for the first time. The story isn’t just a little quirky—it’s quirky, weird and wonderful.

James Marsden gives a game performance as the title character in this fast-paced high-tech action film. In the near future, winners of the lottery live out their lives in total comfort and luxury in New Eden, an artificial paradise created by the government. The lottery is rigged so no one ever wins more than once, but computer programmer Lincoln Six Echo finds that things are not as perfect as they seem. In secret, Six Echo plots his escape with the help of computer genius Jordan Two Delta (Marsden). Now, when Six Echo tries to escape to the safety of The Real World, he is tracked down and chased through a maze-like existence that turns this big-budget sci-fi thriller into something reminiscent of the action classic The Running Man (1987). Based on the French film La Jetée (1962), The One came to American theaters in April 2001.

With the way SFX studios have been churning out giant monster B-films lately, it can be hard to get your giant monster B-movie kicks. Step forward one Jason Ashmore. He not only owns the largest private stash of giant monster B-movies in the world (his wife notes it's like renting from Blockbuster, only the films get returned squashed into smithereens), but he's finally cashed in and converted a fire station into a drive-in. Sadly, a foreclosure notice is already on the door. As Ashmore is in a dire position to cover the monthly repayments and the mounting debt from his passion for big-scale monster-on-monster mayhem, he's forced to resort to showing real-life action to the public in a desperate attempt to get the funds he needs. This goes down a treat with the public - but it's not only the streets that are in danger from Ashmore's 'movies'.

I'm looking forward to Bennett's Nero Wolfe in space, also. Great analysis and reviews, thank you.
Carolyn Cushman July 13, 2015 at 11:19 AM
I'm a longtime fan of Bennett's Wolfe books (and just reread A MASK FOR THE DEVIL in May). He's also written a lot of short Wolfe fiction, but I've only read one or two of those. His take on Stout's characters is intriguing. In my review of the Locus Recommended Anthology THE VERY BEST OF NANCY KRESS, I called his "And Then the Town Took Off" the "outlier" story in the collection, but it works very well and I'm looking forward to seeing how he applies Stout's characters to space. That story is free for Amazon Prime members, and I found the audiobook, if you care to look.
Joe H. July 15, 2015 at 5:03 PM
Well, thanks to your mention, I just finished reading And Then the Town Took Off in the ebook.
I'm going to give Bennett the benefit of the doubt on the puppet nonsense, since he does have a logical explanation. I wasn't a big fan of the book myself, so your review is not a slam against it, it's just a personal, "Eh, I liked some of the things and not others."
However, I do appreciate you calling out the run-on sentences (though they weren't the first thing that struck me) and the random female reproductive bits.
Thanks for a great site, and for letting me know about stories I might not otherwise see.

2024-09-25 03:19:42,013 - Generated text:  solutions for cooperative disaster management in a cyber reality
Virtual reality (VR) may take many forms, but the principle remains: presenting the user with a digitally simulated, three-dimensional, fully interactive world.
But what are the implications of using VR as a concept for crisis response?
The UNESCO Chair in Reorientation of Education joins forces with a US-based technology company, CTRL Labs, to find out, by designing a crisis response VR world together.
To offer an idea of the potential of VR in crisis response, this partnership created an emergency simulation scenario. This scenario, focused on a natural disaster, was designed to challenge users in their everyday lives. Its aim was to examine ways of applying VR technology to cooperative disaster management.
Users were asked to complete specific tasks, either alone or in a group. By tasking users to ‘save’ different individuals in the scenario, the team wanted to test if groups could be better at solving challenges when supported by VR technologies.
The collaboration was able to test the efficacy of different forms of virtual reality, from a sophisticated HTC Vive VR headset and hand controllers to an iPad VR experience and smartphone-based 360° videos. The test also enabled the team to gather important data on each of these platforms.
Based on the experience of its first simulation scenario, the UNESCO Chair in Reorientation of Education will design new VR scenarios to further explore VR technology as a cooperative tool for disaster response.

Life in the court of the prince and heir to the throne is like a game of shadows. The prince has many kings. There are magical beings like dragons and wisps. There are factions of mages and witches. In the midst of this world is Prince Veron. In one year, he will become king. However, until that time, Veron, along with his siblings and other candidates, are tested to prove their worthiness to become king. He must rise through a competition known as the Selection Trials, where candidates compete in challenges to show their fitness for the throne. Veron is not as enthralled by the idea of the throne as others are. He has other plans. He has no wish to be king. He is the son of the queen’s doctor and wishes to be a poet and a playwright. He is secretly engaged to an actress in the royal theatre. His sister, Persephone, is furious. She believes the competition is a game. Veron believes it is his lot in life. The two find themselves in competition with each other for one position, with each other. Their fights are literal and figurative.
My name is Veron Du Lac. I, in the royal court of Salascus, wish to be the next ruler of the kingdom. And I am a coward.
My name is Persephone Du Lac, and I am Veron’s sister. In this competition of endurance, I hope to win.

My Name Is Veron Du Lac, and I Am Not a Prince
My name is Veron Du Lac. I, in the royal court of Salascus, wish to be the next ruler of the kingdom. And I am a coward.
My name is Veron Du Lac, and I have never asked my mother for much. I was a poor little orphan, the black sheep, raised by my maternal uncle. I was uneducated and unloved, passed from house to house, begging for scraps and nicknames. I was a survivor, a pragmatist, the wisest fool in the kingdom, a wretched, worthless beggar.
But that was my past. Now, I am Lord Veron Du Lac, Prince of the fabled land of Salascus. I have a castle, a crown, and a duty that hangs over me like a sword. It is my job to pick a queen, to crown a king. It is my duty, but I don’t want the job. I don’t want to be king.
I want to be a playwright.
I am twenty years old, on the cusp of adulthood, and yet, I still feel like a child. I am still, in many ways, the same little orphan from Fremont. The court of Salascus is a world of secrets, of deception, of danger and danger and more danger. I have always been a foolish boy. I have trusted everyone, even those who should not be trusted. My stepfather loves me, but he is cruel. My sister, my savior, my dearest friend, who will do anything to protect me, treats me as a brother. My mother, whom I have never met, holds me in her love and grief. I could die, and she would not know. I could love a man or a woman, and they would not accept it.
The darker parts of my heart grow, spreading through my body and mind like spiders.
But it is not only the darkness that is waiting in the shadows, watching, listening. There are whispers. There are voices. There is a dark and terrible beauty to this court. It glitters like blood in a starry night. It smells like roses and sweat, all rolled into one. The players are playing for more than glory, more than our own honor. They are playing for everything that is. My heart lies beating against the pages of my diary, stained red from the blood of my ancestors. The secret page is barely discernable, one finger pointing the way to the beginning of the end of the world.
I could die tonight. I could be killed or harmed by a poison in my food. Or, I could be assassinated. There are many ways to kill a ruler. Even the best have been murdered by the foolish.
I’m still not sure if I’m foolish or wise.
My name is Veron Du Lac, and I am not a prince.

In an exhibition on pottery and kilns, top-notch ceramic artworks dating back to the 12th century are displayed alongside pieces from the Tang and Ming dynasties.
Porcelain is one of the most representative types of ceramics in China, and also among the most complex. This fine white ceramic dates back to the 11th century, at the time when the Tang Dynasty began to import cobalt from Korea.
Wenxian Qianzhi Collection
Chinese ceramics have been around for more than ten thousand years, and the oldest ceramic kiln in the world is a Chinese one. Even now, its techniques remain as good as ever.
The world's oldest known ceramic piece is from Yuchanyan Cave in south China's Hunan Province. According to the book, "New Outlines of Pottery" (published in 1930), the ancient pottery dates back to about 20,000 years ago.
In China's Yunnan Province, the Nuo minority group has made pottery for thousands of years. Today, most pottery from this group is used for daily living.
Xinghua Culture Park
The Yuan Dynasty witnessed a popularization of Chinese ceramics. Local kilns sold their wares throughout China, as well as to the Mongolians and Manchus.
For more than a thousand years, pottery making has been an important part of daily life in Jingdezhen, a town in eastern China's Jiangxi Province. It's one of the world's oldest and largest centers for ceramics.
As the largest group of ceramic artworks in China, the figurines from the Qing Dynasty reflect local culture and life in that period.
Nuo Minority Nationality
For generations, the Nuo minority group in Yunnan Province has produced ceramic artwork of various shapes and sizes.
Longyan Tang Bo Ceramic Museum
As early as the Neolithic Age, the Chinese were already making pottery. The Muddle Pottery Culture, China's oldest culture, was believed to have started between 17,000 and 11,000 years ago.
An important material to produce pottery was the fire clay, which can be used to make earthenware. Pottery and porcelain were often referred to as earthenware, but that gradually changed.
Ceramics from the Han Dynasty were decorated with flower patterns and other designs, mainly made for use by the wealthy. As such, they were often referred to as the "king of ceramics."
Taking the legacy of the Qing Dynasty, the Pu Shan Imperial Kiln in Zhejiang Province has been producing porcelain with fine glazes since 1979.
Glazed ceramics were first developed during the Song Dynasty, which used porcelain as a substitute for gold in tea sets.
The ceramics at the end of the Ming Dynasty were large and deep, with much space left on the surface of the pottery. This evolved during the Qing Dynasty, which began making ceramics that had thin walls and detailed designs.
Xuandong Art
In 1965, famous porcelain artist Xu Weilin made a modern porcelain statue named "Spring Outing" which is well known for its realism.
Dishware, such as plates and bowls, is normally called pottery, while pieces of art, such as a sculpture, is considered ceramics.
Ceramic manufacturing has existed for at least 12,000 years, when the potter's wheel was first invented.
In 1974, Chinese potter Xu Weilin went to Paris, where he came up with the porcelain sculpture that he eventually called the Spirit of the Mountain.
One of China's earliest porcelain ceramics was invented during the Shang Dynasty, using white clay, black pigment and traces of glass to make fine porcelain.
First developed during the Song Dynasty, glazed ceramics are decorated with colors such as blue and green, which become popular later in the Yuan Dynasty.
Jingdezhen Art
In Jingdezhen, a town in eastern China's Jiangxi Province, glazed ceramics first developed during the Southern Song Dynasty.

#159: A Hurricane Of Ingredients
Lisa is a young, talented cook working at a well-known bistro. She decides to test the limits of her senses and challenge the rules of cooking by plunging into her darkest desires and urges.
Lisa stands in the kitchen and takes in a deep breath. Her lips move slightly as she recites the recipe in her head.
She's going to make a recipe with multiple ingredients that will be used for something completely different.
She glances around the kitchen before turning back to the stove.
Taking a fistful of black pepper, Lisa stirs it around the pan for a few moments before setting it aside.
As Lisa goes about her task, she begins to sweat more and more. Her face flushes, and her movements grow slower.
When she's finished mixing all of the ingredients together, she pours it into a large pot and places it on the stove.
The pot begins to bubble and steam. Lisa moves closer to it, her breath coming out in short gasps.
She lays her hand on the surface of the pot and lets it feel the heat. It's so hot that it's hard to believe that all she needs to do is cook it.
Finally, Lisa decides to take a step back and let the cooking begin. As she walks away from the stove, her heart beats faster and faster. She is overcome with a sense of urgency and an overwhelming desire to complete the task.
Suddenly, the alarm on the stove goes off. It's 2:00 AM, and Lisa is exhausted. She stands up from her seat and stretches. As she does, her eyes drift to the stove, where the bubbling cauldron of ingredients still sits. She walks over to the stove, slowly, and stares at the contents of the cauldron. The thought crosses her mind that she could make some other food with these ingredients, but she dismisses it.
Lisa takes her hands and leans over the pot. She raises her hands to the ceiling, where she stays for a few seconds before coming back to earth. She takes a step closer to the pot and smells the mix of ingredients. The smell is overwhelming and distracting.
Lisa takes a deep breath and leans closer to the pot, letting her hands stay over the surface of the pot as she listens to the bubbling sound. She looks at the mix of ingredients, trying to come up with something to do with it.
Suddenly, a smile creeps across her face. She puts her hand back in the pot and starts to stir it. She lets it heat up to a low simmer, then puts it back on the stove.
She looks at the ingredients, then stares at the stove. She thinks she sees something, but she can't be sure. She walks over to the stove and puts her hand on the surface of the pot.
As she holds the pot, her hand begins to tingle. She smells a strong odor, but she isn't sure what it is. She takes her hand away from the pot and takes a few more steps away from it. She stares at the pot, not knowing what to do.
A siren sounds. It's a loud, shrill sound that screams at her to leave. She walks over to the door, but she can't bring herself to do it. She walks over to the stove and leans over the pot.
She opens her mouth to breathe in the smell of the ingredients, but before she can, a strong breeze blows into the kitchen. She closes her mouth and looks around the room, trying to see where it's coming from.
The smell of the ingredients becomes stronger. She can't believe what she is smelling. She doesn't know what to do.
She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. The smell is so strong, it feels like it's filling her head. She thinks she can feel her face heat up.
She walks back to the stove and places her hands on the surface of the pot. She opens her mouth to let the smell of the ingredients fill her body

The archangel's hands formed the seal of the seraphim. Lightning and thunder flashed with approval.
The ruler of Heaven brought his creation forth and placed him in the garden.
The dark force heard the sound. It trembled in fear.
Eternal Father proclaimed, "This is good."
As the heavens rejoiced, the dark force fled in fear.
Father looked with favor upon the creation. A perfect union was formed.
The Master Creator anointed this creation with favor.
All the angels marveled.
As the darkness retreated, the light shined forth.
Father smiled and said, "It is well."

2024-09-25 03:19:42,014 - Prompt 135: A magical flea market where every item has a story, including a teapot that
2024-09-25 03:19:42,014 - Generated text:  brought the biggest smiles to my face.
Now, this teapot is magical.
I had been eying it for two years. I was with my wife, waiting in line to pay for an item, when this teapot appeared. It was perfect. Made by a man in Prague, made from recycled copper, it looked like it was made for us. We snatched it, locked eyes with the seller and paid, without even discussing it.
The teapot we bought was a simple one, not gaudy, not glittery.
And when I got home and put it on our kitchen stove, we were in heaven. It was shaped and crafted to be a tea kettle but I filled it with water and used it as a kettle for scalding milk.
There are so many things that I love about this teapot, but I think the part that my wife likes the best is that it’s shaped like a tea cup. It’s a drinking vessel, one we both love.
One year later and the teapot is still a magical part of my home. Every time I look at it, every time I see it, I remember how lucky we are to have such a cool piece. It’s certainly not the most special thing we’ve ever owned but it’s one of the most loved.
I could have walked away.
This has been my thought of the day since I found out that the love of my life cheated on me.
We’ve been going through a hard time these past two weeks. I found out that my wife had been in love with someone else, which shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out, but we weren’t living together at the time and I don’t really do the texting and the social media stuff. So I could have missed it, and at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter. It happened.
She says that she didn’t want to hurt me and she’s right. She’s a good person and a great mother and that’s how she’s going to continue being.
I’m trying to decide what I want to do. The way that I feel right now, I’d like to take the kids and hit the road, but I also know that would hurt her. That’s not fair to the kids, to her or to me. So I’m trying to put myself in her shoes and figure out a better way. I guess the only thing I’ve been able to figure out so far is that I’ll try to fight for this marriage.
One thing I’m certain of is that I’ll never leave her.
I love my wife with all my heart. That much has been obvious since the day we met and has only grown stronger in the past 12 years that we’ve been together. I want to make this marriage work. But if it doesn’t, then I’m not going to let it hurt my children and I’ll find a way to live with my choices. I’m an adult, I can do that. But I’m also a kid and no kid wants to grow up without their mom.
Living in New York City has always been my dream, but as of yesterday, I’ve achieved it. I got a job as an editor for an online magazine that I’ve wanted to work for since I was 14.
It’s a big change for me. New York is a huge city, completely overwhelming, and I’m a bit afraid of it. I’m excited though. For me, living in the biggest city in America has always been a big deal. I’m happy that it’s a smaller job, though, because I think I’m not cut out for much bigger.
A lot has changed in the last five months and I’m sure a lot will change again in the next year. I love it though. I can’t believe I live in New York City.
I’m a kid, I’ve never bought an ice cream cone from a truck before. It’s a big moment in my life, a moment I’m not going to forget.
It started with my mom telling me that I had to go to the park, it was too hot to sit indoors. My dad and I walked to the park and that’s when I saw it, the ice cream truck.
We had to wait for the line to subside and the truck to come to us but when it did, I knew I had to get one. My dad told me it was my first time buying ice cream and that he was proud. I bought a blue

Gabriel Hayman is a Canadian born and American-raised writer, born with the condition, tone-deafness. He is currently working on the sequel to his debut novel, Echo of the Future. He lives in San Diego, California, USA.
I’ve always been known as the guy that isn’t “tone-deaf” per say. I’ve never struggled with pitch nor am I able to distinguish the range of a piano as if it was a photocopier. So when I first learned that Gabriel Hayman’s debut novel, Echo of the Future, was a story about a tone-deaf ambassador, I was a little intrigued.
Echo of the Future is a fascinating story that follows Gabriel as he navigates his new surroundings and culture. There is so much of himself in Gabriel’s character. I’ve always admired how he has struggled with this condition and continued to make his mark in this world. He’s a huge success and accomplishes so much with his life. I’ve always wondered what it would be like to be tone-deaf but, I’m not going to lie, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be able to make it through the day without music. The book features a few tunes from Gabriel and his experience on the cello.
For those who are also tone-deaf, there’s a handy chart at the beginning of the book to explain the tone-deafness and a glossary that provides more information about the language in this parallel world. It was an extremely interesting read that helps you feel closer to the author and the characters, in a way, which makes the story more immersive. I think it’s a fabulous read that I’d recommend to all!

I have been tone deaf my whole life. I can sing pretty well, but I can’t identify pitch. That’s probably how I’d react if I read this book. I love the sound of it and might give it a try.

Harold Lloyd interviewed Lillian Gish during the production of "Beggars of Life."
Lillian Gish became one of the biggest stars in the world thanks to D.W. Griffith.
Her movies "The Birth of a Nation" and "The Scarlet Letter" put her in front of audiences around the world and made her one of the biggest names in Hollywood.
But she didn't arrive there until after being married for three years.
Harold Lloyd interviewed her while they were shooting Griffith's "Beggars of Life."
Lloyd knew Gish before "The Scarlet Letter," thanks to her brother, who was also an actor.
The interview surfaced after it was included in a TV special about silent films.
It's fascinating to hear Gish talk about acting for the camera as well as hearing her insights into Griffith.
At the end, Lloyd asks Gish to play with him and his cameraman. She does, making them laugh.
The short interview is an incredible look into a unique moment in Hollywood history.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,455 - Generated text:  replaced by the raging flames and enormous smoke. The houses were burnt down to ashes. Everything was destroyed, barring few trees, shrubs and some. The entire 35- acre land had been converted into smoldering ashes. There was no respite to the panic stricken residents who had saved their lives and left their homes which were now nothing but a charred heap of ashes.
Sharmi Chakrabarty, a resident of Korberia village, narrated, "It was 11 pm and we were in bed when we heard a loud explosion which continued for 15 minutes. My husband went to the other side of the house to check what it was and returned within seconds screaming 'Fire! Fire!' It was a raging inferno and my husband ran back into the house and shouted at me to wake my children and run. We ran down the burning stairs but my three-year-old was already awake as he had been woken by my husband's crying."
"The wind was blowing fiercely and we couldn't see through the burning pall of smoke, "said 38-year-old Sulekha Das, a Korberia resident.
By the time we had reached the roads leading to Bolpur, our clothes and hair had burnt. The heat was so intense that people started running. We were crying for help but everyone was running in panic", added Sulekha.
The entire village had been gutted in a few minutes. "My parents were praying in the church. I had left my parents and gone to sleep. But I was woken up by a loud noise", said a frightened mother.
The entire village was on fire. It was as if the fire had spread up to the sky. It was a scene out of a horror film. People were running here and there with soot-covered faces and hands. It seemed like the end of the world.
In all 17 houses were burnt in the village and none of them were insured. But amidst the mayhem and horror of the situation, many showed humanity and helped those in distress, including Chandan Pathak, Anjan Tudu, Asish Panda, Binay Kumar Mondal, Arun Kumar Chaudhury, Amit Mondal and Susanta Mondal.
Leader of the Opposition and Trinamool Congress leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O'Brien, who visited the site, said the village had burnt in the 'most dastardly manner'. O'Brien, who was accompanied by his colleague Sougata Roy, was moved by the plight of the people. "The scenario here was akin to an Apocalypse. I cannot even put into words how horrible this looked", he said.
"This is the most inhuman way to destroy someone's house. The villagers were sleeping. It's unfortunate that villagers have to suffer in this manner. It's not a first time occurrence. It's very disturbing. There should be proper control over the Indo- Bangla border. "The present administration is scared of the people and has taken a law and order approach to tackle situations. The law and order situation in Bengal is a cause of concern," O'Brien added.
The eastern state was under President's rule for over a year and O'Brien expressed apprehensions about the current administration and hoped that better days will come soon.
After watching the havoc caused by the fire, O'Brien suggested that the Union Home Ministry should make arrangements to get all the affected people rehabilitated. "After visiting the village, I was shocked by the news of other fires. "It has been reported that there were at least 12 cases of fire incidents in Cooch Behar, Murshidabad and other places. These are indications that the situation is becoming grave," he said.
"It is unfortunate that villagers are caught in the political cross-fire and have to pay the price. I don't have the answer to why such incidents are taking place. It is the government's duty to protect people and give them security and a sense of safety. This incident took place in a particularly sensitive area, where people are living in insecurity," he added.
"What is disturbing is that it is happening time and again. Is it a deliberate attempt? It seems to me that it was a well-planned act of vandalism and defamation. I am appalled by the way these people are being treated. I hope and pray that things change for the better," he

2024-09-25 03:22:14,455 - Generated text:  lived a man. Rarely did he ever venture out from his home. From birth, he had lived an isolated existence; living with his elderly grandmother who taught him that the dark wood was a terrifying place to venture into. Yet from the earliest moment he had seen the wood in his father’s story, he had felt a growing curiosity. A burning desire to know more of this strange place.
He knew he was different; and he knew that the only way he was going to find the answers he needed was by stepping out of the safety of his home and venturing into the forest.
Later, he left his grandmother behind and followed the river onwards, until he came to a clearing where an ancient Oak tree stood. He told his grandmother, he was going to explore this place. It was the tree that had called him, his heart and his soul, but his grandmother was reluctant. When he decided to head off on his own, she chased after him. Yet her legs were not made for running as she struggled to keep up with him, she tried to dissuade him. “I’ve done what I can for you, you must find your way in the world now”, she cried as she reached him. “I have to explore this world”, he said, “I know there is something inside me that is trying to reach out. I have to know more of the world”. His grandmother nodded, tears in her eyes as she watched him leave.
Alone, the young man headed into the forest. At first, it was just like the thick dark wood he had known all his life; the trees closing in around him, the undergrowth overwhelming. But as he went deeper into the forest, the trees became taller and the paths became overgrown. The undergrowth was so thick that even the animals were nowhere to be seen.
His courage began to weaken and he knew he must return to his grandmother and her safety. He started to backtrack, before he saw a creature in the distance. A dark grey horse that seemed to almost blend into the surrounding trees and shrubs. He had never seen a horse in the forest before; and yet the creature was not afraid. It galloped directly towards him; its hooves making the earth shake, branches snapping as it passed. The young man felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up as the horse drew near, and a tingle ran up his arms.
The horse stopped dead in front of him and bowed its head. The horse moved closer, and even though the boy was reluctant to get closer to such an unnatural animal, he was compelled to touch it. He stood next to the horse; then reached out and ran his hand over its soft brown coat. Its body was warm and powerful. He took hold of the reins, and to his surprise, the horse did not react. They stood there, in silence, staring into each others eyes. The boy stepped forward and took the reins into his hands. The horse stepped away, and slowly began to move into the depths of the forest. The boy quickly mounted, and together they moved deeper into the woods.
The forest was truly a terrifying place, even with the horse leading the way, but it was still far preferable to wandering around alone. After several hours, the boy stopped and looked around at the enormous trees, it was almost as though they were like monsters looming over him. The trees seemed to sway and twist their branches in the air around them. The wind, that was so quiet during the day, started to whistle and moan as if it had a voice.
“Who goes there?” A voice boomed out from the forest. The boy jumped in fright, looking around to see where the voice had come from. Before he could answer, another voice called out from the trees. “Who goes there?” It said again. The voice seemed to echo around them, echoing out from all directions, as if it were all around them. “Not you… Oh good,” A third voice answered.
The boy was unsure what to do, he felt very uneasy. The creature that he had ridden in on had vanished and now he was standing alone, surrounded by strange voices and branches moving around him. He decided to run.
He galloped his horse through the trees as fast as he could. Finally, he reached a clearing and the horse came to a sudden stop, causing the boy to fall to the ground. He pulled himself up, painfully, and surveyed the scene before him. The clearing he had found was tiny, surrounded by the enormous trees and with no way to escape. He looked up at the branches

This year's robot, No. 100601, is an improved version of the 'Botzilla.
Instead of scraping things up, it sucks them in. But it is accident prone.
This time a ray gun brought along for play is switched on by mistake, causing complete havoc.
"There were seven cringed-in bots, plus the one flipped over on its back with the large gears sticking out."
Afterwards, everything is normal again, apart from a few glitches in the computer system.
It all started at the Swiss Football Academy. The schoolhouse with its cement yard resembled a car park or a parking lot. At the back, a cement carport and around it, car tyres. This is where, for weeks on end, the construction team worked.
There were grey and orange boxes here and there. Lids were opened and pieces fell out. And a variety of hosepipes, tubes, cables and wires made their way into the boxes.
Every time a mechanic stroked his chin, the suspicion crept into your head that it could be the start of a sentence which started like this: "What if it was this… "
On this particular morning, a mechanic and a few pupils with shaven heads were silently watching a battery, which was in the engine.
The motor was now standing under a blanket. On the spot where it used to stand was a hole that showed the area of the burned paint. It was also the area where a new crankshaft would be fixed.
The green, five-year-old fire engine was the pride of the school. It had been built by hand, a feat that took a lot of time. Since the first day when it was wheeled out onto the schoolyard in front of everybody, it had performed amazingly well, never broke down, the fire department were just as happy as the pupils. This was because the fire engine worked perfectly and drove as if it was a real fire engine.
So it was a strange sight when the mechanical bangs resounded. It was as if the fire engine was acting on its own. It started to walk off towards the school house. Soon, its long, narrow body filled the doorway. Everything went quiet as the pupils looked on.
The fire engine stopped. A few new pupils were shocked, while the older boys just grinned.
The fire engine had rolled into a building.
Of course, it didn't burst into flames. It had not caught fire. Neither was there anything which made it roll into the building. The children thought it was extremely funny.
They knew how much effort the mechanical bangs in the engine were. Therefore, they knew it was a joke that it ran towards the building. The mechanical noise was a result of the pupils switching the engine off. The fact that it rolled in was unplanned and therefore even funnier.
But at the same time, the pupils started to be a little anxious. Did it mean the children were planning to take revenge? The mechanical bangs in the engine were a signal to the other children.
One after the other, the children gathered. Each one of them smiled, but their smiles showed that they were very angry. The roar of the engine filled the school.
A short speech was given and a high-pitched hiss was heard, because the engine could no longer make a sound. Then it was time for the demonstration. The engine rolled into the workshop again.
The children followed the engine into the workshop. The mechanic opened the door. The engine could not be driven in. The only thing that happened was that a small bump echoed.
The engine sat parked in front of the door.
The children knew that they had won. Now there would be a calm moment.
A week later, the children stared at a mountain of bricks, bolts, boards and rolls of steel. There was a large hole in the cement wall. On both sides of the hole, in the metal plates which usually shut off the engine, the mechanic had repaired holes in the engine.
"So it's possible to push it in," laughed one of the boys.
"That's what we call a front door," said a pupil.
The hole was covered with a thick piece of steel, so it was invisible. Soon it would not matter that the hole was visible.
Meanwhile, work started on the engine. The boys put on their dark blue suits with emb

It is the film's wild vibrant colors that give it its vitality. It also stars short filmmaker Vincent Peone, whose film The Signal Man is one of my all-time favorite shorts. That film is also an excellent look into the supernatural.
In another intriguing new film from director Natalia Leite, a young woman named Amy (Mena Suvari, American Pie, The Replacements) undergoes a bizarre and terrifying transformation, as she begins growing glowing porcupine-like quills from her body. The film draws inspiration from a true story, from 2009, when a Canadian woman named Lori Drew began harassing a young teenage girl named Megan Meier online. After Drew's daughter told her the girl was being unfriendly, Drew sent her a message telling her she was "not cool anymore." Sadly, the girl committed suicide shortly after, due to the message and the abuse.
A director who needs no introduction, Francis Ford Coppola, made his daughter, Gia Coppola, the director of his new film, Megalopolis. The film stars Oscar Isaac (Dune, Annette) as the owner of a property development company who has some designs on being mayor of New York. The film follows him through a series of rehearsals as he goes about deciding the fate of the city, as well as a budding romance with Lady Susan Sarandon.
A woman moves into a new apartment and begins to experience all sorts of paranormal phenomena, in Aaron McCann and Dominic Pearce's gripping supernatural drama, starring Essie Davis (Cruella, The Babadook) and Ciaran Hinds (Munich, Frozen). A bit reminiscent of The Invitation, the film follows a woman's desperate quest to find her missing husband.
When his wife dies, a man begins believing he's living in a sitcom. An official selection at the Tribeca Film Festival, the film stars Brendan Fraser (The Mummy, Encino Man), George Blagden (Vikings, The Borgias), and Maria Dizzia (The Deuce, Inside Llewyn Davis). The film premiered at SXSW in 2022.
Based on the Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name by Ian McEwan (Atonement), director Michael Grandage's film stars Emma Thompson (Love Actually, Saving Mr. Banks) and Stanley Tucci (Julie & Julia, The Hunger Games). The film follows a woman living in 1960s London, whose husband, a photographer, becomes involved with a singer who is facing the death penalty for murder.
Nick Robinson (Love, Simon, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom) stars as an overworked attorney in this unnerving supernatural thriller, from first-time director Michael B. Allen. The film is billed as a cross between Rosemary's Baby and The Sixth Sense.
A young couple travels to an unknown town to meet her mother, but finds things aren't as they seem, in this cult-favorite supernatural horror film from Larry Fessenden (The Last Winter, The Incredible Shrinking Man), starring Fessenden, Pat Healy (Cheap Thrills, Compliance), and Roxanne Benjamin (V/H/S, The Innkeepers).
A new gothic horror film that also has supernatural elements, from director Nacho Vigalondo (Colossal, Timecrimes), starring Jack Reynor (Free Fire, Missing Link), Maya Erdelyi, and William Jackson Harper (The Underground Railroad, Black Monday). In 1975, film director Jessica Hollander had a close encounter with a strange, inhuman creature on the other side of a forest. Forty years later, she meets the creature again.

Excuse me? I don't have anything in my mind. I think is pretty obvious that the film is a Tarantino-like film. Doesn't matter who produces the film. If is a Tarantino film, it is a Tarantino film. That is not my opinion, that is the truth.
Never said the film was a Tarantino film...it's just written and directed by Robert Rodriguez, who has done plenty of similar work to Tarantino. I don't know why people try to make everything into some sort of feud between Tarantino and Rodriguez...as if it is a bad thing that these guys are getting along and actually work together sometimes. I'm not even a Tarantino fan, but I like his movies and have no issues with Rodriguez whatsoever.
If it is a Tarantino film, it is a Tarantino film. Not some Rodriguez movie written by Tarantino.
^ Yes, it is, you retarded fuck. Robert Rodriguez is my favourite director ever, and one of the only two to ever give Tarantino a challenge. But I'm not blind to the fact that Rodriguez is just a lesser version of Tarantino with all of the same style and aspects and what not. This is definitely a Tarantino movie, no doubt. Even if Tarantino's main character didn't die at the end of it.
Mutiny on Aug 5, 2010
I am with #22 and #23. I've been a big fan of Robert Rodriguez for over a decade now, but in a couple of ways he's kind of fizzled out in the last decade, in my opinion. I am glad he has Rodriguez's talent to go back to for help in this flick, but if this movie is as much a Tarantino film as he claims it to be then I am sure he is looking to get some more help next time.

Follow Dan and Thin, the dragon, as they embark on a quest to find what they believe to be the long-lost treasure. But if they are unsuccessful, the lives of everyone on the planet will be at risk.
The adventure begins...
The ancient manuscript contained wisdom from a time long past. The clasp was magical. Once removed, the information would flow from the manuscript. The clasp, a dragon, was enchanted so that only the strongest warriors could open it. It had to be a warrior who was ready to use his power to solve a problem. The dragon’s mate had been killed in a war with men. They lived together with their brood in an enchanted tree at the base of a great mountain. The dragons guarded an ancient manuscript that was of great value to all the creatures of the earth. Once a month, a portal opened, and the dragons flew to the spot in the sky where it opened, and collected the information to protect the ancient wisdom. The information contained a warning about the future of their children. With the opening of the portal, the dragons felt it was time to tell the boy of the adventure that lay ahead of him. They invited the boy to the portal where they sat waiting for the knowledge to flow from the ancient manuscript. The portal opened. They all flew out of the small, enchanted tree and flew to the portal. The portal was near the great mountain. The dragons sat at the base of the mountain with the manuscript. The boy, called Dan, hovered around the other dragons, learning to control the element of the air. Dan was determined to learn as much as he could. Thin, the dragon, was the eldest of the group of dragons. He was brown with black highlights and horns. He had a wingspan of over fifty feet. He was the bravest of the warriors of the dragons. He was the one that Dan chose to learn from. Dan looked at the dragons and then at Thin. Thin smiled back. “What would you like to learn first?” Thin asked Dan. Dan’s eyes lit up. “I would like to learn how to breathe fire.” Thin was amused. “That is one of the easiest things to learn. Just follow my instructions and you will have no problem.” Dan gave Thin a doubtful look. “It’s not as easy as you think. Remember the last time I tried?” “Oh, that,” Thin said with a smile. “Yes, that,” Dan said with a grin. “Come with me,” Thin said, and then Dan followed Thin’s instructions. After a week of hard training, Dan could breathe fire. He could also climb a tree with the speed of a falling bullet and with ease. “You are ready,” Thin told him. “Let’s go to the portal to learn more about our destiny.” “What if I’m not ready for this?” Dan said. “Are you ready to save the world?” Thin asked. “Yes,” Dan answered. They flew

2024-09-25 03:22:14,456 - Generated text: , it was promised, time, for once, would stop. Such is the nature of “dead time.”
2020, the year that continues to refuse to end, continued into the beginning of 2021 with a bit of a lie, as we returned to the endless list of horrific things coming at us, month after month, while so many of us continue to cry out, pleading, in desperation, “But what can we do?”
While we have all been “socially distancing,” struggling to protect ourselves and each other from the deadly pestilence and its carnage, we have also been, as a global community, so cruelly separated from each other, physically—a hell of loneliness for so many, that that pestilence is also devouring the very fabric of our humanity.
We live in a system, both subtly and overtly, engineered to promote selfishness and competition among ourselves and to thwart any impulse toward compassion or solidarity. Our institutions are all rooted in a system of profit before anything else, and capitalism is a means for some to survive and thrive at the expense of others. It feeds our exploitation and dehumanization.
In the face of overwhelming and unceasing despair and horror, we must not go mad. We must not just fall into a darkness from which we cannot emerge, because if we do, we will become just another statistic, a casualty of the capitalist death machine. We cannot afford to give up or “collapse” to the point where we can no longer do anything productive. This is especially true if we desire to eventually enact radical change and hope for a better future.
When we are all isolated and lonely in our individual cages of Covid and the world of capitalism, when we cannot touch, talk with, and be with others—we are in crisis. We are experiencing, and will experience in the future, desperate, dark nights of the soul, despair, hopelessness, and depression.
So, we have to gather together in community, a community of resistance to all of these violent forces that would tear us apart and destroy us, as well as our capacity for life and love.
Not a community of togetherness for the sake of togetherness, but a community with a purpose, a community of resistance against this world of capitalist exploitation and oppression, a community of resistance against police terrorism, police murder and brutality, a community of resistance against the wars of empire, a community of resistance against all forms of violence that are perpetrated against us, by our fellow humans and by the capitalist system.
We have to look to each other, we have to look in each other’s eyes and share our suffering and struggles, we have to share our struggles with those who we can reach, and listen to the struggles of those who have shared their struggles with us.
In a world where it seems, at times, as though we are becoming increasingly isolated from each other, we need to cultivate the habits that we can practice with each other, in our community of resistance.
There is a way out of this hell we’ve been living in for the past year. We can live together differently, we can live together in a community of mutual aid, solidarity, and justice, and we can still survive through these difficult times. We have the capacity to create a way out of this world.
Solidarity is the backbone of all collective action. Community does not just happen, we must collectively struggle for it. Community is not an illusion, and it is not a nebulous dream. Solidarity is a real practice that builds an actual community that acts in resistance to oppression and exploitation. Solidarity is not “nice,” it is not sentimental, it is not relegated to people who believe they are special, or think that they are “helping,” it is a practice that is intended to be the active process of “being with,” or “standing with,” others in our shared struggle against all that would tear us apart. It is the process of actively listening to each other, and making space for each other to be heard and be seen.
When you listen to another person, and you take their words to heart and are moved by them, you then have the opportunity to share their struggle with others. And then there is no holding back, no hesitation to share your own struggle with them, because if they have shared theirs with you, then they have already opened themselves to you, to you being vulnerable with them. You are both held together in a fragile alliance,

2024-09-25 03:22:14,456 - Prompt 9: The entrepreneur's vision for a sustainable business
2024-09-25 03:22:14,456 - Generated text:  is deterred by a lack of interest among suppliers and customers.
Given the uncertainty of the supply chains during the Covid pandemic, Vincenzo Cesare, CEO of CLS Lattelien Gmbh in Germany, is used to receiving questioning from suppliers and customers when they learn about the company’s approach to sustainability. He also doesn’t expect a quick uptake of the vision of his multi-country company to convert all its processes to renewable energy, free of charges for customers.
Sustainability is an important topic for CLS, he says. His company has not only built a zero-emission production site at a logistics hub near Frankfurt, but is also going through the planning for a wind turbine on the production site. “We want to become CO2 neutral for energy purposes,” says Cesare. He is looking for partners, also outside Germany, that share this ambition. For this approach, CLS uses a unique delivery concept that uses electrical vehicles powered by renewable energy.
The company imports and distributes products such as fasteners, springs, mechanical parts and accessories from China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and other countries.
It takes 21 trucks to bring the products from China to the distribution site. With the switch to electric vehicles, each delivery would become CO2 neutral and help to meet the company’s CO2 reduction target for 2023. In return, the customers should see a decline in cost.
It's not just the distribution of products to customers. For the company, the journey to becoming climate-neutral starts with the management of energy and costs. Using only renewable energy for power would mean energy would be free. “Nobody pays for it,” Cesare says.
The shift to climate neutrality is more than just about purchasing electric vehicles and making them available to drivers, it also goes beyond the personal contribution of each individual employee to keep a green mentality alive. In its company blog, CLS writes about a very serious incident in June 2021 in which the wind turbine at the logistics hub broke down and required employees to use diesel-powered backup generators for 24 hours to avoid disruptions to operations. "So much diesel was consumed, that 12 new trucks were soon added to the delivery fleet," the blog post says.
The purchase of the 12 trucks - among many others - became a warning sign for the company. CLS sees its sustainability efforts as an investment, rather than a cost, as this also translates to benefits. The company expects a lower cost for each shipment. In the long term, investing in zero emission transportation is the right thing to do and to show that it’s possible to achieve positive business results, says Cesare. “Our customers can rely on us,” he adds.
Deloitte 2021 Global CEO Survey: The pressure is on
The case for climate action from the supply side
Despite the benefits, his efforts are met with some resistance. "Some of our suppliers and customers say they are not ready to invest in electric vehicles,” says Cesare. His response is to remind them that CLS is making the investment because it is a strategic direction for the company and its long-term success. It’s not a matter of “giving them orders,” he adds.
One of the main challenges for Cesare is the coordination of efforts from all over the world. Even in the home country of Germany, there are differences in legislation across regions. The CO2 neutral concept needs to be applied throughout all operations, both in terms of the company’s fleet, suppliers, delivery, distribution and the production site.
"Companies should not wait until there is a regulation for the topic of climate neutrality,” says Cesare. “Because it will take time for regulations to come through in the individual countries,” he adds.
For CLS, the journey has already begun. As for when it expects to fully switch to electric vehicles, he says that it could take a few years. "The positive side is that we can see a transition taking place in the automotive industry," says Cesare.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,456 - Prompt 10: Amidst the ruins of the old castle, a
2024-09-25 03:22:14,456 - Generated text:  charming cottage opens its doors to travellers searching for the perfect getaway. Following the scent of lemon grass and relaxing to the tunes of the ukulele, I had to admit that Paradise is all but lost.
After half a day spent wandering the winding streets of Stone Town, we could do with a place where we could relax. As the last stretch of Zanzibar’s eastern coast road is devoid of the old colonial villages that characterize the rest of the island, we were expecting a bit of a cul-de-sac. However, as soon as the lemon grass lined pavement of a quiet alley came into view, we had our answer.
Our travel agency had gotten us a deal on the Paradise Cottage in Stone Town. Normally it would be much more expensive to book a room with a place that lacks an online presence, but with our solid Yellow Fever certificate and vaccination card, they must have assumed that we were as big of tourists as their mascot Flippy-floppy. Still, we weren’t complaining, and even better: it meant we could treat ourselves to something more lavish than our previous quarters.
Our room was tucked away in the far corner of the cottage, with a view of the wall and no chance of wandering neighbours. The interior wasn’t much to look at, but it served its purpose just fine: it contained a double bed with a mosquito net, a wardrobe and a safe for our valuables. Of course, it was obvious that we’d have to wash the bedding and the towels upon arrival, but other than that we were well set up.
The shared bathroom was a short walk away. Although the sink was perfectly adequate for our purposes, it lacked a bidet, which felt particularly strange since we had already seen one in the laundry room. The toilet was in excellent condition, but the shower was riddled with a multitude of defects. As a result, the water pressure was so low that even with our water-saving devices, we were forced to bathe with our hands rather than soap up with a sponge. Our experience with the tap could have been worse, as it was almost impossible to turn on the water. However, the bucket was more of a challenge to use: we had to be incredibly careful when filling it as the flow was so slow and precarious that it was a feat of balance to walk to the shower and not spill the water.
Despite this, we weren’t overly bothered: the climate in Stone Town meant that our stay was a short one and we had nothing to do but relax in the open air after having spent a day covering miles on end. This was made even easier thanks to the complimentary coffee in the cottage. Although the house’s main downside was the lack of water pressure, the coffee that the owner served to the guests helped compensate for that, and despite the fact that he had just prepared an incredibly rich chocolate and sugar-covered brew that was anything but black, we were extremely grateful for the welcome drink.
At the other side of the house, in a wooden cabin covered with a blue tarp, a boy was fast asleep. He was the next to wake, and it was clear that the daily routine at the Paradise Cottage was the same for him as for us. As soon as he got up, he went to his side of the house where he began preparing a large pot of hot water for the next guests, as well as a bag of ice for those that wanted their coffee cold.
The owner of Paradise Cottage in Stone Town (right) preparing the day’s hot water.
The coffeemaking procedure was the one main activity that occupied our guest. Whilst he made coffee, he also made sure to wash up all of the dishes that the previous guests had left behind, and even hung up the cutlery on the walls of the kitchen. At the moment the guests were still sleeping, he took the opportunity to prepare breakfast. When we woke up, we were able to enjoy the fruits of his labour. He had even prepared some of his favourite Zanzibar food: a plate of fish, another with rice, and a coconut on the side.
Despite the general busyness of the cottage, the owner was there to receive us at the door with a smile when we arrived and departed with the same hospitable warmth. He was always happy to answer our questions about the region, including the following day’s trip to Prison Island. It was

But the detective was wrong, and the murderer was right.
The story could have ended there, but it didn't. It seemed to want to continue. After all, wasn't it his duty as a detective to solve the case?
"Well, come on," he said to himself, "it won't solve itself."
He made sure to set the alarm, in case he had to leave quickly in the middle of the night. He could still hear the moans of the sick man as he prepared to leave.
He parked his car out on the road and started down the steep path that wound its way through the woods and forests. He held a torch, which cast a dim light over the damp forest floor and the treetops that loomed over his head. The detective came to the pond and noticed that the swimming pool hadn't changed. It seemed to have been abandoned, with only a broken slide sticking out of the water and two lifeguard chairs floating uselessly in the pond. But he knew that would be important later on.
He walked through the thick undergrowth, keeping an eye out for nocturnal creatures. He was about to turn back when he noticed the track in the ground. Something had passed by the long way round. It didn't look like an animal, but it could have been a small child.
A dog jumped out from behind the bushes. It was followed by a girl, who began to run. The detective sprinted towards her. He grabbed her by the shoulders, but she struggled, twisting out of his hands and screaming at the top of her lungs. She ran in one direction, and he ran in the other.
The girl disappeared into the darkness.
The detective ran on, keeping her image in his mind. She was wearing an oversized jacket and a pair of high-heeled shoes that squeaked loudly over the pine cones.
After half an hour of searching through the forest, he found her hiding in a small shed. The door was locked, but he managed to break in. A second later, he realised he'd made a mistake. A dark and evil smell of rotting food hung in the air, and when he searched under the straw and sticks, he found a sickly, pale, naked man. He was clearly mentally ill and badly in need of medical attention. But the man looked terrified and started crying when he saw the detective.
The girl helped him up.
"Please," she said, "let's just go."
The detective studied her face in the faint light. He was suddenly convinced that the police would find the missing girl and her father. He didn't know why he thought so, but he had a feeling that everything was going to be alright.
"We have to return to the police station," he said.
"But what about my father?" she said.
"What about him?"
"I have to save him. They'll kill him!"
"Sorry," said the detective, "but we can't."
He knew she didn't understand. The girl looked terrified. The pond, the sick man, the murderer in the room and the track she'd left in the undergrowth. He didn't understand how she knew all that, but it didn't matter. She was desperate. She could hardly breathe.
"I'm really sorry," said the detective.
He opened the door and led her outside. He let her go first and then followed. She walked up to the detective and reached out for his hand. He could see the lining of her dress sticking out from under the torn coat. There was blood on her hands and she couldn't stop crying.
"I'll never see my mother again," she said.
"Oh, that's terrible."
"I'll never see my father again."
"I know it's terrible, but you must listen to me. You have to. I don't know how I can explain it, but my father needs to be dead. You have to understand that, you have to. If he survives, he will become a murderer. I know this is difficult for you to believe. But trust me."
"I know it must be difficult for you," she said. "I'm so sorry."
"You must leave him," said the detective.
She looked at him with tears in her eyes.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Prompt 16: The novelist typed the final words of the
2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Generated text:  "Rosenwald Schools" on her laptop in a Manhattan hotel room. There are only two spaces between "school" and "s"— a familiar sight to editors and proofreaders everywhere. No one appreciates the power of those two spaces more than Rosenfeld, who is fascinated by the absence of space on the page. Her latest book, "What is Missing," is an exploration of the omissions— in grammar, in memory, and in love— that are essential to life.
When the author's mother was dying of breast cancer in 2011, her father refused to give up on her. In a hotel room in Boulder, Colo., a few months before she died, he watched videos of home movies. Through tears, he reread the small, bound photo album. "I don't know why I have kept it for so long," he said. "I keep hoping that one day I will remember what we're looking at."
In "What Is Missing," Rosenfeld follows in her father's footsteps, foraging for artifacts of the past. But the search for traces of memory leads her to "a fundamental and basic issue: what it means to remember and what it means to forget," she writes.
She is fascinated by the "hippocampus," a part of the brain that preserves memories and enables a person to construct a coherent story of his or her life. "We know that the hippocampus is responsible for converting short-term memories into long-term ones, but it is difficult to understand exactly how it works," she writes. "A long-term memory is an amazing thing. We want to preserve it and we fear losing it."
After her mother died, Rosenfeld began thinking about her own long-term memories. She was anxious about the date on which she would receive her first copy of "What Is Missing," which was to be published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux on May 14. On May 12, her father called to say he was taking a plane to New York, but he didn't give a reason. A few hours later, he said he had had an accident. He was seriously hurt and unconscious in the hospital. His doctors didn't think he would recover.
After a few hours, she tried to call her brother. He had sent her a text the day after her mother died, telling her, "I love you. I love your family." She didn't respond.
Her brother was dying, too. He'd had pneumonia. "My entire family had been wiped out," she said. "I don't remember what I did, but I was literally on the floor." She called his doctors. "He was in this coma, but he was still alive," she said. She asked if she could visit him. "I didn't tell him what was happening in my family."
Her father died in the hospital on May 15, 2012. "I came home from the hospital, and I knew there was a copy of my book waiting for me," she said. "It was a surreal experience."
Two months later, her brother died of pneumonia. "It was like being sucker-punched," she said.
When the author began writing "What Is Missing," she was 14 years old. She had grown up in Washington, D.C., but moved with her family to Saudi Arabia in 1976. She remembers the name of her middle-school English teacher—"Mrs. Rockwell"— but says she doesn't remember much else about seventh grade. She met her husband while both were undergraduates at Harvard, but she can't recall a single class they took together.
She recalls a day in 2006, after her father died, when she tried to explain who he was to her sons. Her father had been a businessman who helped educate children in the United States and Africa. The boys thought this was an amazing thing. But, she realized, she didn't know the details of her father's work. She didn't know about his trip to Boulder to watch the home movies or the fact that he had shuttled his mother back and forth between schools so she could study math and science. "I felt ashamed," she said.

She did, however, know about the books her father had read. She also had her own memories, as well as journals she kept during her youth. She spoke to her mother, now that she had dementia. "

2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Prompt 17: Hidden within the ancient texts lies
2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Generated text:  evidence of our ancestors being some of the most complex people who have ever lived. There is no question that they were not just intuitive in terms of their spiritual journeys, but highly technical as well. Not only is there evidence of their advanced knowledge of astronomy, astrology, and chemistry, but there is even evidence of them having access to technologies that were far beyond what is available to us today.
For the longest time, ancient alien theory has been disregarded as ridiculous, simply due to the fact that it sounds too fantastic to be possible. If we were to focus more on what we know about our own ancient ancestors, and less on what the public has been told for the past several decades, we would find a lot of evidence supporting such theories.
Because of this very reason, the case is made that the ancient texts were left to us to help humanity in our attempts at deciphering what our future may hold.
Numerous ancient cultures often depicted what is known as the “man in the sky” across numerous ancient cultures. This would include references to the Hindu gods Vishnu and the Phrygian god Attis, as well as references to the ancient Greek gods Zeus and Hermes. For a great many years, this has been something that the majority of scholars believed to be just a myth.
It’s interesting to note, however, that these depictions have now been found to be correct. On Mount Imeon, which is near to the Macedonian city of Edessa, there is a giant stone pillar that is called “Alexander’s Column.” It is 23 meters in height, and it depicts the face of a bearded man with the visage of a serpent. On one side of the face, there is an eagle, while on the other side, there is a lion.
There are many researchers who have come to the conclusion that this is, in fact, what has been described in the ancient texts as the entity, “Anubis” which is mentioned in Egyptian mythology. The most likely candidate for this is the alien known as the Annunaki.
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of evidence that there is an entire fleet of alien spacecraft that is waiting in the asteroid belt. These ships were apparently launched by the Anunnaki, and the halls of Eden are likely to be located inside of one of these motherships.
Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this entire situation is that the remains of these spacecraft were recovered from ancient ruins across the Middle East. It has also been estimated that these spacecraft were over 500 feet in length, as they were designed to carry entire generations of the Annunaki.
There is another interesting fact that can be derived from these vessels, and that is that they may have been designed to have a very long lifespan. Perhaps one of the reasons why the Annunaki decided to leave this planet is because they may have discovered that their ship was nearing the end of its lifespan.
It is fascinating to note that not only do the ancient texts mention that there was an alien fleet that was waiting in the asteroid belt, but they also mention that the aliens came from the inner and outer ring of Saturn. These are realities that many of us simply don’t have a comprehensive understanding of, even though we have been told by scholars for generations that the Earth was always the center of the universe.
As these texts have been deciphered over the years, there has been a lot of fascinating information that has been recovered. One of the most prominent features of these texts is the fact that the world was only one of many in the cosmos, and that we have all been put here to reach the next phase of our development.
Perhaps one of the most interesting things to come out of these texts is the fact that humanity isn’t alone in this galaxy. It has been proposed that we are in the midst of an ongoing war between two different groups of extraterrestrials who want to have complete control over this planet. As we have seen, it is very possible that these two factions of aliens are currently battling each other for control of our planet.
Because of this, we may want to start thinking of what these aliens may do if they are able to gain access to Earth. We have long assumed that this would mean that they would start to offer us their “help,” which could quite possibly be for the worst.
There have been several documented cases where alien abductions have taken place, and they may also have led to the creation of what many researchers are calling the “grey alien

2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Generated text:  can't penetrate and the depths are untamed and dangerous, there is a creature that grows so large and takes up so much space in the small parts of the ocean, that is known as the giant squid. The largest ever to be found was over 60 feet long, but that is very rare and mostly only found in cold waters near Antarctica.
The giant squid's eyes are more than a foot wide, which is about the size of the eyes of the world's biggest bird, the ostrich. It has no skeleton, like most squid and fish, but it has 10 tentacles on its head, each one holding around 3000 suckers that can suck prey up from the sea floor. This makes the giant squid very dangerous, and very deadly to its prey.
Giant squid are one of the deepest dwellers in the ocean, going as deep as 16,000 feet. They are found deep in the waters of all oceans in the world. They are one of the few creatures that can be found in the north and south poles.
The giant squid lives in the ocean for it entire life, and is not usually seen near shore. They are deep-sea dwellers and that is why so few have ever been caught. Scientists are unsure what will happen to the squid when the ocean heats up because the giant squid only lives in deep cold water.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Prompt 19: The jazz musician's melody filled the air with
2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Generated text:  bluesy notes that I just couldn't listen to. A few years ago, if you heard jazz, I'd be wanting to go dance. Not anymore. Today, when jazz music started, all I could do was fidget.
That fidgeting went on long after he left.
The Starbucks was fairly full, but almost all of the customers were focused on the screen of their laptop, reading a book or tapping out some text on their Blackberry.
I, on the other hand, was fidgeting and occasionally rolling my eyes. It was irritating that the guy kept playing that sad, bluesy music.
Okay, wait, don't get me wrong. I don't dislike jazz. In fact, I used to like it a lot. In college, I'd pick up that blue saxophone or the black upright piano and start playing to the song of my soul, my heart, and my life. I'd find myself tapping out a beat on the table, and I wouldn't realize what was happening. Jazz music was a way for me to escape, a release from the pressure of my studies, the need to meet the deadline for my dissertation. It was also my way of putting all the frustration in my life into order. Even my passion for young Daniel put a smile on my face, and I'd play to that too. I would smile as I watched that young man find love in his own place in this world.
So, jazz music was the soundtrack of my life. And then Daniel came into my life. Jazz disappeared, at least for me. My husband brought a different kind of soundtrack into my life: bluegrass music. Not once, but two separate times, bluegrass has moved me to tears. I haven't played jazz in many years. And I doubt I'll ever pick it up again.
On the other hand, bluegrass will be with me for the rest of my life.
So here I am fidgeting as the sad, bluesy notes fill my Starbucks. One person in this room even tosses his head back and says, "Ahhh." What a horrible response, for what is left to say?
I have to laugh at the fact that my husband is off in Africa doing some important work for that charity he is involved with. At the same time, I think I can guess what he'd be saying to this: that musician has some sad music going, and he's touching a lot of people here. If he could see the same people here as he's singing, he'd see that they all have some of their own sadness to deal with.
You know, it's all about perspective.
I had another reason to fidget. I was on my cell phone, flipping from talk to text to talk and text. I needed to give my mom a call and a quick text to Daniel, since I was running late.
Oh, wait, one more reason to fidget. I had to leave to give a very important report to my boss in just a few minutes. That report was looking very glum on my face as I glanced over the paper. What a relief to see that darn musician walk over to the piano. He grabbed the keyboard and started strumming out some, "And then I will set you free...." Oh, such a release.
By the time I saw him on his way out, I realized what I'd just been listening to. That saxophone was soothing, bluesy, and beautiful. I don't dislike it anymore.
No, actually, I loved it.
How long has it been since I played my saxophone? You know what? I bet Daniel would be a good person to give me some music lessons. After all, my mom and I are good at those dance lessons. That little boy taught me to follow the steps, so he can teach me how to play that saxophone!
As I finished up my report to the boss, I couldn't help but feel relaxed. Maybe this was my son's way of telling me I'd done a good job with the report?
I guess he was telling me, "And then I will set you free...." Maybe I'd already set myself free.
You know what? I bet I'm going to go buy that saxophone this weekend. I have to check with my husband first, but I think I'll be okay. I think I'm going to start playing some jazz.
It just might be the soundtrack of my life.

I saw Penguins of Madagascar when it was in theaters and I liked it. I actually saw it twice. I have a soft spot for the DreamWorks Animation feature films because they are pretty entertaining to me. The film is pretty short and it does introduce us to a new group of penguins, even if they were voiced by the same voice actors we’ve gotten to know over the years. I like how DreamWorks would make these awesome films that have really awesome characters and bring them together in a film that really has a lot of heart. I was definitely excited to watch this one.
The animation in the film is really well done. It really is some really amazing animation. I liked the way that the world felt and how the penguins looked. It’s really fun to see the characters do things and see how they are animated. I especially like the way the characters move and how the voices are used in conjunction with the animations. I think it does a really good job of showing that the penguins are in different levels of motion and how they are portrayed in the film.
The film is not that long. It doesn’t take very long to start and then it is over. I really enjoyed the film and it is definitely a fun time.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,457 - Generated text:  theory of evolution
German-born Eugenia Chancellor (1862-1932) was the first American woman scientist to study paleontology. Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, she began working at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, studying and identifying local fossils. During these years, she also studied at the University of Pennsylvania, earning an M.A. in the sciences in 1885. She spent the next three years studying zoology at Berlin's Humboldt University. She returned to Philadelphia in 1889, taking a teaching position at the Academy of Natural Sciences.
In 1892, Chancellor took a trip to Europe, funded by her grandfather, to collect fossils from England and France. On the trip, she met French paleontologist Paul Gervais, who encouraged her to pursue her interest in fossilized teeth. Chancellor became fascinated with teeth, working at the Royal Belgian Museum to catalog fossilized teeth from Africa and central Asia. Upon returning to Philadelphia in 1895, she was appointed curator at the Academy. She spent the next six years studying teeth and reconstructing the evolution of the world's fauna, as well as teaching and publishing numerous articles in scientific journals.
In 1901, Chancellor traveled to China, as part of a study of Asiatic and African fossils. There she collected samples of 500-million-year-old fish teeth from the Yenching University campus in Peking. The Chinese teeth became the basis of her groundbreaking 1903 study of Cambrian era fish, her work being hailed as a landmark in paleontological discoveries.
In 1906, Chancellor won a two-year Rockefeller Fellowship, which enabled her to return to Europe to study fossils in the Museum of Natural History and the Zoological Institute in Berlin. She also continued her research at the Academy, publishing 35 articles in science journals during the 1910s.
By the time she was 47, she was exhausted from her years of traveling and teaching, and retired in 1910. She died on March 19, 1932, in her native Pennsylvania.

A dog in a fight pit has acquired a bite on his neck and it is slowly growing. A man with a hammer is on the lookout for more dogs to hurt, and he notices this one and pays for the pleasure. He enjoys the torturous game of hammer-bite and then puts it to death.
Pictures like these disgust people. Hundreds of soldiers complained that Fuseli’s romantic visions of violence were “undignified, and impious as well as against humanity”. That is why the painting was removed from public view. We still, however, have 40 years of imperial London at our disposal for appreciating the scourge of bloody reprisals.
To mark the bicentenary of the battle of Waterloo, the city of London is holding a dramatic series of military events. It was first thought to be a party of the elite. The expense of the event has given rise to much outcry. The British government is encouraging us to visit another well-worn site.
Downton Abbey has been booked for nine nights in late June and early July. Trains and coaches take guests to the green pastures of Carfax Park. There, one is invited to revel in a re-enactment of the Wellington-Napoleon duel. It is inevitable that violence is part of the celebration.
This is war, so anyone caught up in it should be prepared to fight.
Many onlookers must have been impressed with the drama of the battle. A gentleman from Cheltenham describes the barbarity of French hussars in this pamphlet, printed by Lady Anne L. Cadogan. It was re-printed after the battle in 1816.
The hussars could not believe how many horses fell as the French cavalry was marching on the British squares. They moved ahead of their troops. We knew that the English horse would die, and the English foot would run. They were broken by our charge.
When we saw that the British were within their squares, we knew it was the time to act quickly. The French cavalry ran ahead of their infantry, and they were the first to be greeted with 18-pound shots. We reached the squares and decided that the French artillery needed to leave the front line. I can still see the balls roll off the squares and on the French officers’ helmets. Their horses were in anguish.
As the enemy artillery was retreating, it was time for me to pursue. Our lances met the British muskets. I hit him, and he fell backwards into the ground. I pursued, and he was on the ground. I had hit him again. We were greeted by the enemy.
Those who die in battle are greeted by the Lord. They were greeted by the women and girls who screamed at them.
Pamphlets like this one are available on eBay for a minimum price of $5.
Ten years after the battle, this depiction of Wellington’s victory was on sale. An old shoemaker and his wife are fighting over the breakfast table. The shoe has been neglected and is being fixed by a military tailor who has returned from war.
A knife has gone missing. It was concealed in a sandwich that had been placed on the table.
The soldier has just stabbed his wife. She is dead and he is remorseful. His fate was revealed in a pamphlet that included a drawing by this unnamed artist. The soldier’s name was Richard Woolnough. He was convicted of murder and executed in front of the King’s Head Inn at Shrewsbury on October 10, 1821. The pamphlet was sent to the authorities and published in the following year.
In this pamphlet, another man had killed his wife because she had accused him of being unfaithful. The man had had a fight with her before he killed her and then attempted to commit suicide. He was pardoned after he had spent time in prison.

To the left was a rocky cliff; to the right was the big, blue ocean. It was a perfect day. We pulled into a gas station and called Mom and Dad to tell them we’d be home in a couple hours.
“I see you brought some friends!” Mom said as we walked in the door. “Hey, do you think you can drive, you know, out here in the country?” she asked as she lifted her eyebrows and shook her head. I laughed and thought of Dad in the passenger seat as he shook his head “No.” I answered. Dad stood by the sink washing a bunch of dishes. I think he wanted to say something, but I couldn’t see him.
“Dad, are you crying?” I asked. “What’s wrong, Dad?” Mom asked.
“It’s nothing, I just got some dust in my eye,” he said. He wiped his eyes with his shirtsleeve.
“Are you sure? Are you OK, honey?” Mom asked.
“Yeah. Let’s finish up in here and then go out and tell them we are going to the lake!” He smiled. “If I don’t get in the water I think I’ll die!”
“I’ll be right back!” Mom said as she ran out the door.
As we walked out the front door Mom was already in her car driving off. I laughed and thought, I have to tell you about yesterday but then I can’t stop and think of all the things I have to tell you and I might cry because I know this is goodbye.
After we were in the car Mom turned around and said, “Let’s go down by the lake and then we can eat some of your dad’s blueberry pancakes.
The lake looked so beautiful that morning. We sat on the dock and ate our pancakes. The sun was high and the water felt warm. Dad was so happy, jumping in and splashing. “You have to get out and we can have a swim together!” Mom said. Dad nodded as he waded in deeper. I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes as I watched them swim.
“I have to tell you something before we go,” I whispered.
“You want to tell us now?” Mom asked.
“Well, the bad news is that we are out of gas,” I said as Dad and Mom laughed.
“The good news is that we are out of gas!” Dad said.
We put our stuff in the car and headed to our house. When we got there we hugged each other and then we went inside. We made some sandwiches and ate them. I took my dad to the car and then he left. I ran upstairs to my room and cried. I cried because Dad and Mom were leaving and I couldn’t make them stay. And I cried because I couldn’t tell them all the stories I wanted to tell them.

But the scientists, artists and surfers who use surfacing air as a point of reference often forget to explore one vital attribute: sound. There’s a lot more noise at sea, and it’s changing faster than at any time in history.
The fossil fuel economy is underwater in every sense of the word. It might take us a few centuries to figure that out, but for now, the most pressing issue of marine ecology remains the noise itself: an increase of decibels of sound in the ocean over the past 40 years from human activity is moving more whales, fish and other aquatic life toward the surface, where they are more likely to encounter boats and other vessels.
“One part of the story is that what was already pretty loud—you know, we have many ships and it is noisy,” said Lilian Schmahl, a behavioral oceanographer at the University of Technology in Sydney. “What’s actually not well known is that every year we are getting more noisy, and we are not hearing the benefits of that.”
When scientists have raised issues about human noise making the oceans louder, some have argued that the impacts on marine ecology are inconsequential. But for fishermen, surfers, aquatic species and marine mammals, it’s clear that the story has changed. It’s a bigger challenge than just noise pollution, and the science is only just catching up.
Despite the warnings about the looming specter of inaction, some of the first noise barriers in the world to the point where surfers were banned, and some of the earliest calls for action, have come from a cluster of New South Wales fishermen and surfers. For decades, fishers have faced calls for shutdowns from late-afternoon to dawn, and in a few locations, efforts to provide surfers with noise barriers to protect them from boat noise.
Nicole Pinnington, one of the surfers who fought for a reef barrier at the New South Wales town of Wollongong, has been surprised to see the level of the pushback. She said the efforts by the surfing community to fight for the project have never been recognized in the academic literature and the battles have gone unnoticed.
The scientists on the other side of the barrier, concerned about marine noise, have seen some pushback from surfers and fishermen and, to a lesser extent, oil drillers and a few other parties in the area, such as the military. And then there’s the boating community. “If you start talking to those groups about noise pollution, they will tell you ‘I’m not the problem’,” Pinnington said. “I find that absolutely baffling.”
The researcher at the University of Canterbury who led the study of the noise barrier at Wollongong, Marianna Bachman, has been working on the project since its beginnings and says the science has always been there. Now that the barrier is in place, she’s seeing its effects. She says that marine life is changing their behavior by looking up. “We’ve had more whales seen, more dolphins seen, a lot more seals and fishermen,” Bachman said. “But the one we’ve been most excited about is the sperm whales. Those are big whales, they live in the deep ocean, and they are becoming more abundant on the reef than anywhere else.”
One of the first groups to fight back was a group of fishermen, who have been fighting the installation of the barrier in court since its inception. They argued that the fishermen would have to move out of the way and that the noise would block out their ability to catch fish. A court found the argument “unsatisfactory”, and the barrier was eventually installed in April 2014. “It was very clear to us that the environmental science is something that should not be disputed,” said Ron Robards, the chairman of the Aquatic Alliance for the Great Southern, which has represented the fishing industry for decades. “So I don’t think we should be in the position where we say that a scientific view of what’s happening in the environment is wrong. I don’t think that’s where we are at now. We can’t dismiss the scientific evidence because it doesn’t fit our world view.”
As the calls for action get louder, the researchers are looking for answers to questions they’ve long hoped to ask. A better understanding of how to silence the sounds of the deep sea might make it easier to deal with the problems. “What we don’t know is

The archaeological survey of Peloponnesus under Margaritis Mavrommatis is one of the most important and comprehensive works in the field of the ancient Greek architecture and archeology and has a permanent place in the scientific literature since 1909.
The publication is organised in a tripartite scheme:
1. The 1st Book treats the entire Peloponnesus on the basis of a systematic excursion
2. The 2nd Book and the 3rd Book are dedicated to individual sites and regions of the Peloponnesus, each in three different locations
The first book includes the ancient sites in Attica and the Peloponnesus and is intended for a systematic archaeological excursion.
The two further books deal with the excavations and explorations. Each book consists of three main parts.
In the first, the form and the accuracy of the drawings are discussed; in the second, the historical background and the first archaeological studies are treated; in the third, the results of the excavations of the researcher are presented.

Wolfgang Schmidt. He works at the stables and hopes to work with turtles. He also volunteers with local animals shelters to help their lonely dogs and cats.
The stables have two buildings. One is the entrance and the main part of the stables. The second is the horse farm and a cage for animals. It’s very old and dirty. It’s also where dogs stay. I love dogs and wolves, I have four of each. I used to have cats too, but not anymore. My cat’s name was Tro, Tro Tro. I had her when I was eight years old. The next year I moved into an apartment and decided that it would be nice to have a cat. I was looking around for a stray cat, but the lady who lived next to me said that she didn’t want to give her cat away because it was old. I said that I wanted it anyway, even if it was old.
It was a funny thing to see. I’ve seen a lot of cats in my life and Tro was very different from the other cats. She could sleep for one hour and she would be ready to eat again. She was very old, like 16 years. When she died, I was very sad. She was my only cat. I now have four dogs. I only have two more months until the breeding season and then they have to go. The dog who I have the most, I have him since I was born. His name is Rambo. He’s not a good dog. When I go out, he goes to the beach and plays with the seagulls. Sometimes, he’s very drunk. I also have a new dog who is two years old, her name is Brenda. She’s the best dog. I give her milk, like when she’s a baby. Then I give her a leash and lead her to the place where she’s born. She’s from the west coast. She runs with the other dogs.
When I walk with Brenda, I also take her brother, Aston Martin. He’s a very clever dog. He knows to how to open the door and when I have an apple he can help me take the seeds out of the apple. I love him. I feel like he’s a child who never grows up.
The next time I asked for more milk, I had to push the pump harder than ever. I wanted to be careful that I wouldn’t break anything so I was trying not to push the pump down so hard. When I finished with it, I thought that I would just carry it home but the milkman said that he would take it to our kitchen.
“And how can I do that?” I asked.
I can’t believe that I’m going to drink milk at my parents’ place. I’ve never done it before. My father doesn’t like milk. When I was little, I never liked milk but now it has to be chocolate milk. I’ve never done it before because my father didn’t like milk, but he doesn’t come home anymore.

Her parents were looking for her for almost a year and then got back to Germany as it was too dangerous to keep looking for her.
They were surprised to discover that their neighbors had been watching her grow up and never told them. She became an author and they had no idea until she decided to write a letter to thank her grandparents for taking care of her.
However, the worst part is that her grandfather never made it to the letter and now he is six feet under. The letter was never sent and now it has been lost again. But the librarian’s great grandmother found it and is now looking for her lost granddaughter so that she can return it to her.
It turns out that she has found a lost family and a great legacy as well.

We loved writing about Kramer's dark secret, getting to show how that influenced everything he did, and playing with the idea of really being able to read minds. This idea for this story came up while we were writing the fourth script.
Honestly, the story in this episode was all about the actors having fun. We love getting to create stories for Pete and Sheldon, and how they react to things, but when we got to writing this story, we got to write something really fun and strange and a little off-beat that's only like this for Sheldon, but can be a different kind of off-beat story for the other guys. It's a lot of fun.
I love the fact that there's a bit of a nod to The Big Bang Theory there. This is certainly a 'gather the cast' kind of episode, so to make the most of that idea, we played around with it in the script. Sheldon is in total contrast to the Bakers. They are warm, open and real. Sheldon is smart, aloof, eccentric and downright strange. It was a nice juxtaposition to the scenes.
The first draft of the script was written by Jeremy Howe. After the episode finished, he was asked to write more episodes, which he did.
The theme of the episode is the stupidity of reading minds. When this episode was being written, Howard and Raj did not have phones.
Originally, Amy didn't join the cast on the flight to Texas.
Jim Parsons wasn't particularly enamoured of the script. In an interview for the Blu-ray release he said "The whole point of the episode is Sheldon's gonna read everyone's minds. And I had a really hard time figuring out what my reaction was gonna be to that, because I was like, 'Oh well, he doesn't read minds, how can he read minds?'. It was really kind of a dumb set up, and I had to go back and have a beer and figure out a real reaction."
Parents, you'll need to be okay with your child hearing swear words to watch this episode.
At one point, before the episode was written, the actress who plays Sheldon's mother was going to be on the show.
To make things even more awkward, they were all stuck on a small plane which was creeping Sheldon out as much as he was reading their minds.
This was the only time all the actors played together in the same episode.
Another interesting idea that was discarded was that Sheldon's mother would meet and befriend Bernadette. They liked the idea of a female friendship between two women who'd both married geniuses.
Sheldon's favourite TV show is "The View".
The moment where Howard is left to watch his kids alone is Jim Parsons' favourite moment of the entire series.
Inspired by the Big Bang Theory panel at the San Diego Comic Con in July 2009, the writers wrote this episode.
The part of the episode where Sheldon was teaching everyone how to read each other's minds was cut down to a mere 13 lines. However, after reading through a draft, it seemed important to reinstate more of this scene.
The prop mind reading machine was found in the Warner Brothers studio store.
In one scene, Leonard is seen holding an old phone from the 1970s, but the device isn't actually an old model. The writers simply used an old phone from the 1970s just to sell the joke.
The young Sheldon actress was worried about playing a spoiled child. However, she loved the part.
One day while watching the "Friends" reunion, the idea for this episode was born.
When Amy told Sheldon about his mother "living with a man she barely knew," he was so furious that she even had to go over to "neutral face" to not start screaming.
This episode was 3rd highest rated in Season 1 with a rating of 4.7.
On TV Guide, this episode has the lowest ranking of 1000 episodes. With a rating of 7.3, the worst episode is The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,459 - Generated text:  a thin layer of white, but by the end of the day, it had quickly melted. Before we knew it, it was late spring again. A reminder that, despite our best intentions, the weather is always something we have to adapt to, not simply control.
If we’re lucky, we won’t need to adapt as often as once every 100,000 years, but we should also prepare ourselves for the possibility that some of our best adaptive plans won’t be adequate.
In June 1917, British battleplanners were convinced that they knew exactly how World War I would progress for the next six months. This included the time of year and location of the next big battle. We know this because they wrote down their plan on paper and sent it to the opposing side.
The British plan was so specific, in fact, that the French and the Americans took a large hand in it, as well. In order to battle across such a large area, several hundred thousand soldiers would be needed. They would also need many, many thousands of horses.
We know that the battle plan went awry because there were many more civilians than expected who became refugees and required rescue. That’s because more of the civilians than expected were women. These women quickly became of great help in the recovery effort by carrying ammunition and setting up medical care centers.
Because of the human element, the best plans that we make are always somewhat influenced by what happens. The longer the plan lasts, the more conditions we have to adapt to. Things become more complicated.
That’s why the time to plan is not at the moment of crisis, but when there is still time to develop adaptations.
Maybe the only way to be better prepared for the unexpected is to accept that the unexpected is inevitable, and plan how we are going to adapt when it arrives. In other words, let’s develop plans to develop plans to adapt. And then let’s hope that we never have to use those plans.
One of the most important events that happened for me in 2015 was meeting Professor Antonio Damasio. Damasio is a professor in the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behavior, and the Director of the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California.
The reason that I was surprised by his response is because he has such a strong personal connection to our business. After all, what he knows more than anything is the brain and human emotion.
Damasio’s book, Self Comes to Mind, is required reading for new sales managers and it’s one of our top three best selling books of all time. This is because he teaches that learning how to manage our emotions is the most important skill we can develop, and a major contributor to how well we achieve our business goals.
When I asked him how he was able to see and understand this all-important business connection to the brain, he gave the credit to two of our products: MindScripts for Closing and Motivational Management 2010 for Closing.
What a compliment that is! I share it with you because we hope that we are able to help you bring the MindScripts sales tool to your entire organization. I hope that, when you do, you think of us, because I have to admit that I’m still surprised.
About the time that my college graduation was in sight, I found myself sitting next to a very important person who, to this day, continues to have an impact on my life.
Her name was Angela Elia and she was in one of my early economics classes. She was attending school on scholarship and told me that she would like to meet for coffee. We met at Starbucks, and when I told her about my academic goals, she asked me what I intended to do after graduation.
I didn’t really know what my future held. I did have an idea that I might like to pursue real estate, so I began talking to her about some of the steps I could take to move in that direction. She told me that she was working on her Master’s Degree and that she had also considered real estate, but she was really interested in helping people manage their emotions.
She suggested that I talk to her boss, a Professor of Psychiatry at Stony Brook, who was interested in bringing a new way of looking at behavior into the study of psychology.
I did meet with her boss, Professor Anthony Damasio, and he gave me a brochure about his program. I was amazed to find out that the program was modeled after what we know now as neuroscience. Damasio’s wife, Temma,

2024-09-25 03:22:14,459 - Generated text: , a parasitic plant, Hydrilla verticillata, is growing unchecked. Slowly but surely it’s changing the chemistry of the lake, making it easier for invasive species to thrive. This is why Kendra Shirmer, director of the New England EcoStation at Oak Hall, is in charge of an ongoing project to reduce Hydrilla.
The project began a decade ago, and although it is starting to work, the task is proving more difficult than originally anticipated. It took ten years for the lake to be infested with the plant, and it will take at least another decade to eradicate it.
The Oak Hall campus is surrounded by woods and is bordered on two sides by the Berkshires. The lake, approximately 16 acres in size, is spring fed, so the lake level rises and falls on its own, replenishing throughout the year. Ms. Shirmer and her team of seven started out by hand-picking and removing the Hydrilla from the lake, and they discovered that the water was depleting quickly.
“We were afraid the lake would go down and never come back,” Ms. Shirmer said.
A lot of factors go into determining the water level, and it takes months of observation to determine what level is safe. To prevent a loss of water, scientists are working to keep the lake at its optimal level. They use a series of measurements such as water depth, weather, and water temperature, among others.
Fortunately, they were able to save the lake from disappearing completely, but it was a near miss. In order to make the lake healthier, it’s not just about the amount of water; it’s about keeping the quality of the water stable.
On the west side of the campus is the boarding area, where the cottages are situated. When students have free time, many like to explore and walk along the lakeshore. On a small, rocky shelf, one can find a statue of a fisherman holding a fish. This is to commemorate the lake’s significant historical presence.
Before the arrival of the boarding students, the only activities held on the lake were sailing, canoeing, and fishing. The decade-long removal of Hydrilla is the first time the lake has been ecologically healthy in many years. Kendra Shirmer explains that the parasitic plant, originally introduced to the U.S. in the 1970’s, has decimated the lake’s native plant life, which is necessary for fish and animals to survive.
Now that the parasitic plant has been removed, the lake is returning to its healthy state. But the task is tedious and takes time. Native plants, such as cabbage weed, water lilies, water celery, and pond weed have been re-introduced and are starting to thrive again. Native animals, such as dragonfly nymphs and turtles, are returning to the lake to take advantage of the thriving plant life.
The success of this project can be credited to the grant funding, community involvement, and unwavering dedication to the cause. Ms. Shirmer has kept records of the work being done to help the lake, and she has documented the amount of Hydrilla removed and the number of animals inhabiting the lake.
She has used these records to write grant proposals for the last decade, and so far, she has received five grants, totaling approximately $50,000. The town of Lenox has also contributed funding.
The five grants have come from organizations such as the Berkshire Natural Resources Council, the Bubb Fund of the Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation, the Berkshire United Way, the Hilltown Community Fund, and the Lenox Rotary Club.
The boarding students on the lake’s shoreline are the reason behind the re-introduction of native plants and animals. Without boarding, there would be a shortage of revenue for the research and removal of Hydrilla. The students are able to see the positive effects of this project firsthand.
The New England EcoStation has an admirable track record of conserving and restoring the land surrounding Oak Hall. But one might wonder: how can this be sustained?
“The project has done very well. It has taken a decade to start getting results, but the progress is happening. We are getting there, and we will continue doing this,” Ms. Shirmer said.

Almost but not quite. I hope the story returns to my mind. I have not abandoned it.
It was a little better then, if I must say so. But I only took five minutes to write this. Not enough. I should have done the entire story.
This story is crap. I'm sorry.
I love writing this. I love all the chapters I have written so far. But I will never publish it. Why? Cause I don't know where to stop. I don't know what happens next. I have no idea how the story will continue.
So, here I am, writing something I know I will not publish because I'm afraid of not knowing where I'm going with this story. I'm afraid of not being good enough. Afraid of failing. And now that I'm scared of this story, I don't want to give it all I can. I want to stop, but I can't stop. This story is in my head. I feel like I'm making my brain explode. I'm sorry. This is terrible. But I just have to write.
This. This is the point where I get lost and don't know where I'm going with this story. I'm sorry. This will probably never be published. But I'm glad I wrote it. This is the first time I actually wrote a story because I wanted to. It wasn't for a class or anything. I just wanted to. And that's how I am. A writer who wants to write because she likes it.
I love my characters.
Hello everyone! I'm sorry for not posting.
But I just finished writing another chapter of my story.
In fact, I have been working on it non stop. I only took a short break and I wrote another chapter.
I have so much on my mind.
I need to work on my book cover.
I just got this idea of what I want the cover to look like.
So I just had to share this with all of you.
It's a late night and I'm still not done with my story. It's a bit too long. But it's nice writing it like this.
Okay, just another chapter.
That's right, I know what will happen in my story. That's how writers are. But I'm not a good writer. At least, not yet. I'm still working on it.
I don't even know where to stop. But I guess I'll just take it a day at a time. That's how writing is. You take it a chapter at a time. But I want to be better.
This is probably the only chapter that's not perfect.
But I will go back and edit it.
This chapter is very short, but I had to work on another chapter of my book. This is only a piece of the story. It's not the whole thing.
I have so much I have to tell you. This chapter only tells the beginning.
This is not a fan fiction, at least not yet. I just finished writing it.
I had to write it. I had to tell this story. This is how it all began.
I have to say, this is the second chapter that's been good. I finally got it right.
And what? This is a cliffhanger?
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

Solitude is the prerogative of a select few; it is the gift of only those who can be without the company of others. – Ursula K. Le Guin
Alone in an airplane seat, I felt lonely. There I sat, the only passenger in the small cabin. Yes, I was going somewhere spectacular, but I longed for the comfort of my husband’s touch or the friendship of another soul. If I had just a few more hours to spend in Argentina, would I consider the opportunity to meet up with another traveler?
As if on cue, my question was answered. A man stepped from behind a curtain. Dressed in traditional Argentinian style, he was joined by another man who was lugging an odd contraption I’d never seen before. It was large and flat and wrapped with straps and cords. Did it have a handle? Did it serve as a seat or simply a means to carry something? How on earth would I explain the strange sight?
The man and his friend set up a small table between us. They began to pour wine into small paper cups. It was time for a tasting! The straw colored liquid was sparkling. I breathed deeply to savor the aroma and considered the scene. Two men from Argentina were about to share their culture with one foreigner. I felt lucky.
We clinked glasses.
“Salud,” the host said. He asked me if I liked wine. He smiled. The second man, who seemed shy, leaned in and said, “Chau-chau!”
I laughed. They were eager to know about me, too. They asked about my trip and my time in Argentina. We sipped the wine as we conversed. The vino tinto was light and fruity. I learned that the three men worked at the winery we were scheduled to visit the next day. They were enjoying the sunshine and the view from the back of the airplane. For them, this scene was simply another work day.
I was the curious foreigner, thrilled to be along for the ride.
When the bottle was nearly empty, they handed it to me. I gestured for them to fill it again. As I drank, I imagined that these men were also enjoying this experience. This moment, even if it was only a few minutes of their day, might be a highlight. If I were the pilot, I would never fly so low and allow so much scenery. But because these men were here, they were enjoying the ride.
This is what I’d read about. If you were to ever travel alone, you would be a person of interest. If you are a foreigner, you would be a mystery. Yet, as a woman, you would be labeled an interesting target. I would be observed and I would be explored. I could assume that strangers would be attracted to me and would crave a chance to get to know me. I was prepared for a new relationship with people.
Later that evening, I was relaxing on the couch in my cabin, enjoying the fresh wine and a view of the Mendoza countryside. When the room attendant, Carlos, came by to clean, he set a glass of sparkling wine down on the table.
“Salud,” he said.
“Tenemos un problema,” I answered. I told him that I was saving the wine for the next day because I’d been warned that some were better than others.
“Pero esto es bueno,” Carlos protested.
“Si, pero esta es para mañana.”
Carlos stared at me, incredulous. “Señora, ¿qué es para mañana?”
Carlos thought I meant that I was waiting for something else to be available. I couldn’t tell if he was more disappointed that I had already drunk the wine or if he believed that I would enjoy something else better than the sparkling wine he was giving me.
Had Carlos thought that I was going to drink the wine the next day? Had he hoped I would wait until tomorrow to enjoy a taste of the vino tinto? Would this have seemed like a sweet offer, or like a suggestion to wait? Or, because I am a woman, did he assume that I would be so thirsty for a little taste that I would take the first wine that was presented to me? Did he assume that I’d be too eager to try his boss’s best wine?
Alone, in Argentina, I felt watched.
“El vino se aguanta,” I responded. “Pero el vino se ha llenado.”

2024-09-25 03:22:14,460 - Generated text:  heartbeats synchronized in perfect harmony.
Created by Felipe Galindo
The audience listens to a soundtrack of their choosing, the music does not play. They must listen in silence, with their heartbeat, to the music.
Silent Theatre Concert (Research)
Do you know how synchronization affects sound, heartbeats and emotions?
When individuals follow the same tempo or rhythm, it improves their sense of well-being and can lower their blood pressure and stress level. We have known that two people synchronizing their movement create harmonious and attractive effects on an audience.
We have also known that music is processed in several parts of the brain at the same time. These areas activate feelings such as empathy, joy, sadness, and other emotions. We believe the creation of a synchronized environment can improve the way a person perceives music.
In this work, we used two of the most accepted forms of music—soundtracks from movies and classical music—to test these theories.
We use heart rate sensors and beatboxes to measure and synchronize heartbeats to the rhythms of movies. The audience is invited to put on headphones with the audio of their favorite film or music, as long as it has a clear beat. They sit on stools that have sensors, placed on each side of the seat, and hear the soundtrack through headphones. Their heart rate is synchronized to the beats and rhythm of the music, which means that they hear the music with their heartbeat. The audience is invited to follow the audio of the movie as they wish, while their heartbeats are also following the tempo of the music. The effect is immediate: they feel the music and the movie, as they perceive it is coming from within.
First we study how synchronization affects the musician and the audience. We measure and quantify the way these effects influence their brain.
Next we develop a method to measure and simulate the feeling of synergy between music and heartbeat. We introduce them to the audience as a group of synchronized entities, and then perform tests to prove that synergy does occur.
Finally, we combine all these elements to create a "hearable" theatre experience, where music is felt as well as heard.
Perhaps, the future of our creative industries will be to produce art that engages the audience through their body, instead of just their senses.

We were there for the morning routine, when the stall was open and the guests started to arrive,but the essence and the story never changes.
The beautiful setting for The Market Project is the Grace Morrison Hotel built in 1922.The stunning and the unconventional design is attributed to the renowned architect Gerald Gardner,who took influence from French chateau architecture which is evident in the intricate detail of the balustrade and the symmetry of the many bay windows.Today it has been transformed to a grand four star hotel and it seems we have much to thank Gerald for.
The Market Project shares a very special relationship with this beautiful heritage listed Hotel,the photos you see were taken in the early morning before the hotel guests arrived,the baker to whom we will be giving some of our treats each day,his beautifully constructed pastries and breads that are filled with love and the perfect creativity of a man who started baking in his own kitchen,and now with his son is sought after by market stall owners and foodies all over Melbourne.
His name is Jonny Yip of Cafe Mosaic and his son Jack (4) is the apprentice,who was making rounds with the baskets,the horses for the ladies hat and the beautiful silk handkerchiefs that each stall owner was wearing, with pride and his mum Marion Yip was keeping a watchful eye.
The stall owners are a creative and talented group,each with their own story to tell,this project has brought them together for the enjoyment of good old fashioned food, art and conversation.
One of the first visitors of the day, in amongst the baking are candy almonds and handmade soaps, was at the table of Christian Ferres.
Christian, who is from a French family is of Italian descent,where his father was an olive oil farmer, his mother an antiques dealer, and today a jewellery maker, producing beautiful bespoke jewellery with coloured stones and glass beads.
Christian has brought his heritage to the market and shared it with us through his gorgeous handmade jewellery.
Another stall owner I was excited to meet was John who has left his wife back home to travel the world selling his beautiful teas.
These tea balls are loaded with flavour and have a number of health benefits including being calorie free, they are gluten free and full of antioxidants.John shared with me his theory that tea is the third oldest beverage in the world after water and alcohol, and they have an unspoken flavour in the taste buds and a potent medicinal effect on the body.He does not have any beer or bacon flavoured tea, but I love that his passion for a tea business had him travel the world and today be in Melbourne sharing his teas.I am taking some home.
Each stall owner told a very individual story of how they came to the market and their passion for it,the market owner was a joy to talk with, warm and welcoming.
It was also exciting to hear from Glenn Evans who at 61 is the youngest of the market stall owners and has been a market stall holder for over twenty five years.Glenn, inspired to go for his creative side started cooking and making preserves, he takes us back to the early days of his career when this is all he did, and how at first it was tough and he was sceptical that this was what he was supposed to be doing.Glenn has always had a number of markets he travels to each weekend,and has been to Paris, the United Kingdom,and Adelaide.I loved Glenn

A clean energy future.
An innovative 42 megawatt-capacity plant in Iceland, Elkem Helguvík, will generate hydrogen by using a special process known as electrolysis. The process involves the use of electricity generated from renewable sources, to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen generated is then used for different purposes.
The main use will be to produce the high-purity carbon-free hydrogen that is a key building block of the transition towards a low-carbon society. Hydrogen produced by electrolysis is a key solution for reducing CO2 emissions in hard-to-abate sectors. In the future, hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources has the potential to become a major driver of change in our global energy system.
The plant is scheduled to start operation at the end of 2021.
Our commitment to powering sustainable change.
Elkem is investing NOK 6 billion in a new hydrogen electrolysis plant at the site in Helguvík.
This follows Elkem’s sale of 30 per cent of the energy plant on the condition that the rest of the shareholders remain committed to continue to develop electrolysis as a future technology for the energy transition.
Energy supplier Reykjavik Energy, the Icelandic government, and Vakin, an energy transition investment company, hold 30 per cent of the shares each. Elkem’s partnership agreement with the other shareholders ensures that Elkem will continue to be a driving force for the development of electrolysis as a clean, green energy solution.

Press release: Elkem and partners set the foundation for future-proof growth.
Elkem and partners set the foundation for future-proof growth.
Elkem and partners are planning to construct a new 42 MW green hydrogen electrolysis plant in Helguvík, Iceland, with the objective of delivering 60 kt/y of green hydrogen to be used in Elkem’s own industrial processes, as well as serving the fast-growing local market for low-carbon fuels.
Elkem is investing NOK 6 billion in the project, and the other shareholders Reykjavik Energy, the Icelandic Government and Vakin, an energy transition investment company, will provide the remaining funding, subject to reaching the financial close. Elkem’s partnership agreement with the other shareholders ensures that Elkem will continue to be a driving force for the development of electrolysis as a clean, green energy solution.
Green hydrogen is a key building block of the transition towards a low-carbon society. It is essential for the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors like industry, transport, and refineries. Green hydrogen is also essential to support energy storage, as a way to avoid the need for CO2 emissions from electricity generation. Hydrogen can replace oil-based fuels, with the flexibility and sustainability of wind and solar power, and hydrogen as the primary energy source.
“We will continue to scale up our investments in renewable energy and electrolysis technology, as part of our transition to a cleaner energy future. Elkem Helguvík will play a key role in accelerating the energy transition and accelerating the use of green hydrogen as a low-carbon fuel.”
In parallel, the partnership agreement will provide a foundation for future growth opportunities in the green hydrogen space. Elkem’s objective is to produce high-purity green hydrogen at competitive prices and thereby enable Elkem to reduce carbon emissions in its own processes and operations. The green hydrogen will be used for production of CO2-free lime and other products. Green hydrogen could also potentially be supplied to the emerging green transport sector.
“We look forward to entering into a partnership agreement with Elkem and to cooperate with Reykjavik Energy and the Icelandic Government in the development of green hydrogen production in Iceland. We are convinced that this new project will contribute significantly to achieve a carbon-free future and at the same time create new opportunities for investment in Iceland.”

New fossil evidence discovered
Scientists now know the origin of life in the universe, and it is simple, they say. The first biomolecules appeared on the surface of Earth 3.95 billion years ago, far earlier than previously believed. They appear to have come to our planet on meteorites.
As it turned out, scientists first formed microorganisms by hand, and then all our cells had to look at these microorganisms for a long time. They evolved into bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
This is the first evidence of the transition from the initial form of life, which can be traced through the fossil record, and microbial cells that inhabit the planet to this day.
In a new study, researchers analyze the chemical and physical composition of rocks to learn how molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen formed billions of years ago. Some chemicals break down, while others remain, and many scientists study them for fossils of biological structures.
The rocks examined in the study included a biotite mica crystal, a semiconductor that changes color when exposed to ultraviolet light, from ancient mineral samples in ancient Australia. Scientists found small bubbles with an optical pattern that is characteristic of green fluorescent proteins. It is similar to the proteins that are present in the bacteria of today.
The researchers found that the composition of this biomarker was most like modern bacteria. This suggests that, by at least 3.95 billion years ago, primitive bacteria had an ability to use light to obtain energy.
This discovery, which will allow scientists to better understand the geological history of the Earth, is important for the study of the origin of life on the planet. The research was published in Nature Geoscience.
Earlier it was reported that scientists have found a 3-million-year-old shark tooth in the Australian mountains. This is a serious evidence that the Earth’s tectonic plates have already been there 100 million years ago.

Epic Games has announced a new tool to accelerate the development of Unreal Engine projects – you can already try it out. The new Accelerated Installer, which will soon be open to non-commercial users, is designed to increase the speed of updates and the installation of the editor.
The system is built using a special mechanism that applies not to individual packages, but to the entire archive, which includes all the patches. This will accelerate the transfer of data, as the system will download the updates and correctors first and then install them in the specified order.
It is noted that the Accelerated Installer will be updated every two weeks. If the developers do not come up with something new for two years, the company will give up maintaining the tool.
During the coronavirus pandemic, more people use online games. According to a report from Sensor Tower, in the first quarter of 2020, the mobile version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive received 1.6 billion downloads and earned $ 200 million. This is twice as much as last year.
However, by the end of the year, this figure decreased by 65%, but in 2021, a record for all time was broken – 1.5 billion downloads and $ 250 million in revenue. Thus, the game became one of the top 20 most downloaded on mobile, even ahead of some of the usual TikTok.

Talent was a pretty wide term at camp, but it was better to be vague and give the campers the freedom to decide what they wanted to do. From acting to singing, to painting to drawing, campers put on an impressive show for their peers and counselors.
We were given the instructions to put on our best performance – after all, it was the talent show, and everyone wanted to win the prize at the end. The prizes were always exciting and fit into the theme of the week – perhaps, as at Junior Camp, it was the infamous yo-yo.
If you had won at the camp talent show, you knew you were a real winner in everyone’s eyes. With the list of campers who’d won the prize up on the board, it was clear which children were the most talented of the bunch.
Watching the talent show was always the most entertaining part of camp. When everyone had finished performing, the judges had a difficult job trying to decide on the best performers. However, the children could always help their friends out by voting for the children they thought were the best, so it didn’t always have to be left up to the adults.
At the end of the summer, we always had an award ceremony where the campers received their awards. The camp talent show was always the highlight of the ceremony, as it was the chance to see who had won what. The prizes weren’t the only thing we were after though – we also wanted to make sure that we were all one camp family and recognized the campers that had been at the camp with us for the whole summer.
One final aspect of camp I’d like to talk about is the legendary but controversial Senior Camp.
The Senior Camp at Rockbrook Camp for Girls was a secret society of campers. This was a group of 13 and 14-year-old girls who were considered the “oldest” campers at camp. They would hang out together, lead activities for the young campers, and work on camp committees.
Many of the girls that joined the Senior Camp took on the position of Counselors-in-Training, or CITs. These girls would assist the counselors and participate in different camp activities with the younger campers.
During the Senior Camp, the counselors would leave these girls alone for a few days while they went out and explored the great outdoors together. This was their chance to bond and learn about the amazing outdoor experience.
Although it was referred to as a Senior Camp, it was definitely not an exclusive camp. When I was at Rockbrook Camp, girls as young as 8-years-old attended the camp. There were always a few girls that were ready to join the group.
Once they were part of the Senior Camp, they became part of the camp family and were known as “Senior Camp girls” by everyone at Rockbrook Camp. They were the oldest girls at camp, but they were still one family.
While at camp, I loved the independence that came with being at camp. We were away from home, in the beautiful North Carolina mountains, with our friends and counselors.
I was very excited to be in the group that was chosen to become part of the Senior Camp. When I arrived at camp, I couldn’t wait to get to work. I knew this was a great opportunity to learn more about what it means to be a leader. I was sure that by helping the younger campers learn about camp, I’d be learning so much in return.
The first thing we did at camp was start our camp buddies. This was a very important task for the new Senior Campers, as they would work with their camp buddies for the next 8 weeks.
My camp buddy was Tiffany. She was a 9-year-old girl from North Carolina, and I couldn’t wait to get to know her. She was very excited to be a Senior Camper and I was sure we’d become the best of friends.
The first few weeks of camp were all about getting to know one another. We went through our daily routine of camp and learned about camp activities and what life was like in the bunks. We also participated in special activities such as roasting marshmallows over an open fire, or playing tag games under the stars.
One of the first things that we did together was to lead a camp activity. This was our first real chance to prove our leadership skills, and I was sure

Today was perhaps the most colorful day of the trip. I arrived at 6am, just as the sun started its trek across the sky. The early morning light hitting the Tetons was spectacular.
I decided to go into the National Park early this morning, to watch the sun come up over the mountain tops. In retrospect, I'm glad I did it. From dawn to dusk, the Tetons are painted in ever changing colors. The shadows cast from the mountains are breathtaking.
I went through the Snake River Canyon on the Grand Teton Parkway today, and found an interesting scene. A large herd of Elk were in the Snake River area, at the base of the Grand Tetons. I pulled over to the side of the road, and watched them come down to the river to drink. In the distance, a female moose walked by, in what was probably her territory. There were some calves, and a couple of males with the herd.
During the day, I'd been stopping periodically to do photos of the scenery, and taking in the incredible views. In the end, I really wish I could go back, to shoot at different times. Every location I went to, had beautiful scenes. Each photo was a challenge, as the lighting constantly changed.
My wife and I had decided to camp in Grand Teton National Park. We spent the night on the Jackson Lake Road. I was lucky enough to get a site near the shore, and I took the boat out for a paddle after dinner.
The water was absolutely still. I could see the reflection of the Tetons in the water, and the colors on the mountains looked spectacular. To my left, I noticed a large herd of Elk. After shooting photos of the Elk, I decided to paddle out to a different section of the lake, and shoot from the water.
I was hoping for a good sunset, but the night turned out to be cold and windy. I stayed up as long as I could, trying to get some photos of the lights on the mountains. The wind was coming straight down the lake, and it was freezing cold. I couldn't get the boat to go back to shore, so I had to paddle to the side of the road, and wait for the truck to pick me up.
It was a long cold night, but the sunset over the Tetons made it worthwhile.
I drove from Denver, Colorado, to Estes Park, Colorado, for a night before heading to Jackson, Wyoming. It was quite an interesting drive, and I loved the variety of scenery I found on the way. From the Grand Mesa National Monument to the Continental Divide, the landscapes were unlike anything I'd ever seen before.
It was the beginning of rush hour in Denver, when I decided to pick up a large container of soup for dinner. I pulled over to the side of the road, and popped the hatchback on the car. I had just pulled it up, when a large black bear came running out from behind a tree, and went straight for the container. It had a look of hunger on its face, and it tried to open the hatchback with one hand. Unfortunately, it couldn't open it. In the other hand, it had a bouquet of yellow and purple flowers. I'm not sure why it was carrying flowers, but it was a pretty odd scene. It then turned around, went to a clump of brush, and disappeared.
I did notice that it was wearing a small chain and bell around its neck, so perhaps it belonged to a nature preserve. The entire scene was surreal, and for me, the memory of it will be forever etched in my mind.
For dinner, I had a big pot of soup.
Today was my first day in Denver, Colorado. I spent the night in a B&B near the Colorado Convention Center, and early this morning I started walking down Broadway.
I had been to Denver before, and I knew that I would be walking down many of the same streets I had in the past. As I made my way down 16th Street, a different type of man was walking with me.
I saw a man wearing a grey suit, hat, and sunglasses. He had a stylish grey walking stick in his hand, and he wasn't talking. He walked past a group of people, who had gathered to listen to some street musicians. Every time he passed a crowd, they would stop talking to watch him. At one point, he came down to a bench, where some men were sitting

The sea, the sea, the beacon, one can not speak of one of the most beautiful places of the city, rather the beacon that greets the city of Trogir and every sunset. And when the sun touches the sea and seems to paint the world, the beacon burns with light for its people.
And finally, everyone, even the children can see the lighthouse, which is visible from the water and the land, and is the best destination for every sunset or night walk, because it's the best place to enjoy the sea, a drink and sea views.
When you are in Trogir, you will probably stay for a long time because you will not be disappointed with it and you will not find a better place to be at every moment of the day, in the morning to prepare for a new day, at noon to sleep and in the evening to eat and drink and feel the emotions of all ages.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,461 - Generated text:  the scientific world.
“This invention is a milestone for humankind, for it adds new joy and new power to all our work, and for it promises great benefits to all men who apply it to their work or to their business.”
Today, the invention of that young inventor stands as one of the greatest accomplishments of humankind: the lightbulb.
While the lightbulb’s modern form has hardly changed since Thomas Edison invented it in 1879, the thousands of practical applications of this invention are now so ubiquitous that it is nearly impossible to function in society without using lightbulbs on a daily basis. However, these lightbulbs are actually a compromise. Some consider it unfair to be stuck with today’s lightbulb options that compromise cost, efficiency, and safety. But what if we could have a super efficient, inexpensive, and safe lightbulb that produces its own energy?
According to new studies, we might not be far from achieving this goal. The National Science Foundation has funded a three-year, $1 million dollar project headed by Edison and Dr. Rick Smalley of Rice University in Houston, Texas. The group is constructing a device that might just make Thomas Edison's vision a reality.
Their goal is to use semiconductors to conduct light between two ends of a bulb, eliminating the need for an incandescent filament that consumes 90 percent of the energy used in a lightbulb.
The group believes that their device could possibly be 90 percent more efficient than a lightbulb and will produce much less heat, cost less to manufacture, and, hopefully, last longer.
While Dr. Smalley believes that the lightbulb’s popularity is “the basic flaw of capitalism,” he still has a high opinion of the new device, stating that, "I think the technology has more impact on the world than anything Thomas Edison ever dreamed of.”
Thanks to this new lightbulb design, we may have found the closest to a utopia the world has ever seen: endless light and energy at a much cheaper price.

She is a life-long ghost and a long-forgotten woman, but her time in the public eye was before Cullen’s story takes place. A massive fire destroyed the Grand Hotel and killed many wealthy citizens of Sweetness, Texas. It was during that time that Linda Garrett mysteriously appeared and discovered the bodies of the victims. A ghost hunter soon appeared, and more people wanted to learn about ghosts.
Now, we can meet Linda again in her story in The Devil's Devil in Cullen’s Memory of Water! Linda has learned that her husband has been having an affair and her daughters are no longer speaking to her. The two women are back on speaking terms, and Linda is intent on saving her daughter’s life. She learns about an old ghost hunter in the town of Sweetness, Texas, and she wants to meet him. Only she isn’t going to show up on his doorstep. She’s going to send a dead woman to speak to him and have her set up a meeting with Linda. How can Linda convince a man that a dead woman is a live woman? She doesn’t know, but she’s willing to give it a try. Linda learns about a woman who is an avid ghost hunter and wants to help her.
The story of Linda Garrett continues in Cullen’s Memory of Water. A woman has moved into the home and is already the talk of the town. The story of Linda’s ghostly encounters is beginning to gather steam in the town. But there’s something else about this woman. A woman who might be able to tell Linda’s husband that he needs to tell her why he’s been having an affair.

The story of a cursed man.
From the Cullen City Mystery Series, Cullen’s Memory of Water tells the story of a local legend. When a fire destroys the Grand Hotel, leaving it a shell of what it once was, a young man’s body was found inside. His legs were gone, and there was no sign of the man himself. There were strange clues, and the next day, the locals saw a ghost.
The police investigator who was looking into the incident claimed that the man’s name was John Cullen. But that name was made up. The young man who was found there wasn’t named John Cullen. He was named John Waters.
The strangest part of the story? No one seems to remember the man.
In Cullen’s Memory of Water, we follow a ghost hunter named Linda Garrett. She learns that her husband is having an affair, and she begins to investigate her husband. When she learns that the woman’s name is Linda Cullen, she’s determined to figure out the truth of the ghost

2024-09-25 03:22:14,462 - Generated text:  survival
Hiking through the Gobi desert is as much about finding water as finding shelter for the night.
It's also the first thing you think of when setting out. If there's nothing to take a sip from and quench your thirst, you could be in serious trouble.
Such was the case for this unidentified hiker, who ventured out on an unknown route in Mongolia's Gobi Desert and fell short of making it to civilization.
"He set out on foot and used his satellite phone to send a text message to his parents," reports AsiaWire.
"They passed away the previous day and left him with a hiking and camera equipment worth 35,000,000 tugrik, or $17,000.
"Although he would never again touch his prized possessions, they were very useful to him on his lonely trek.
"The message he sent his family was found and passed on to the authorities, who have now launched a search to try to locate him.
"So far the trail has led to an abandoned horse stable, a lamb that survived the heat but died after its owner buried it.
"And the grave of the man's parents who both died in the final hours of their walk.
"They only had to go a short way. When they had enough energy to carry on the journey, the hiker took it upon himself to give them the necessary assistance.
"He helped his parents dig their graves and even marked their final resting places.
"His wallet, mobile phone, and camera were then buried with them."
All he left with was a small bottle of water and a note that read: "I want to be found and I am happy."
These details were provided by the report, and it is not entirely clear whether this is the truth.
Nevertheless, this gives you a very clear indication of the type of toughness you need to survive in such a desolate landscape.
Despite the beautiful scenery that he got to see, it would have been more than worth it to meet with a more desperate fate for the sake of his parents.
In his last moments, all he asked for was to be found.
No one wants to go to their death without being remembered.
Unfortunately for this unnamed person, his journey would have a tragic ending that would mark his body with the call of the wilderness.
In these situations, humanity often times plays second fiddle to the elements.
But there are also the strengths of people who see death as the door to new possibilities.
It's like stepping into a whole new world.
With a green light to get on with life after a tough battle against the weight of your existence, there is no telling what you can accomplish in the face of extreme odds.
Rather than one moment leading to the next, life goes on in a continued stream of time, but its source always comes from the same place: within us.
In the face of a stark desert, there is no greater horizon.
When humanity looks toward its future and faces its past, there is no telling what will happen next.
The only thing you can be sure of is that there is always hope.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,462 - Prompt 66: The old fisherman's tales of the sea were both captivating and
2024-09-25 03:22:14,462 - Generated text:  terrifying. Those of us who did not live on the sea feared it because the old men could talk about it as if they knew it intimately and because of the many terrible things that happened in it. My uncle Jacques' favorite tale was about a little old man who sat in a tiny wooden boat with a black skull and crossbones for a sail. "He is the Devil, Miroir," Uncle Jacques said when he told me the story. "He steals innocent children away to keep them hidden in the black waters for the rest of their lives, waiting for them to grow old enough to be used to build another ocean."
My father claimed the Devil man was a real person who had bought his soul to the evil one in exchange for certain secrets of the sea. My mother thought the Devil man was another uncle, one who had stayed in the sea instead of returning to his family. My mother's father was called Captain Poubelle, or Garbage, by his family, and the story is that the Devil was Captain Poubelle, now an old man so far out in the ocean that he had forgotten to live as a man. I have always wanted to believe Uncle Jacques and Father, because they seem to know more about the sea than I do.
We have always lived on the mountain and only heard about the sea in Uncle Jacques' stories. He has said that all his life he has wanted to live on the ocean, but he never has. I wanted to join Uncle Jacques and swim with the fishes, but our life in the mountains, close to the black stone quarries, has never been so inviting. The mountains are as grey as a storm cloud, and there are no fish in the river except in its clear and peaceful pools. There are fish in the sea, and even a fish like me, because there are two kinds of fish. There are the human kind, who have no teeth, no bodies, no warmth, and are said to make their homes in the deepest depths of the sea, and there are the little kind who live in the streams and ponds, in the rivers, and who have teeth, and warmth, and bodies. Fish like me have no names. Some of us think of ourselves as Miroir, which means mirror, but really we are like mirrors, not actual mirrors, with no faces and no names.
For as long as I can remember, I have been a fish, and I don't know how to do other things. The world is made up of water, not air, but there are times when the water turns to clouds and streams and rivers and snow and rain. Sometimes the world is so flooded with water that the fishes become air creatures, like the ducks and the birds, and can no longer swim. I think that one day, a day I can't even imagine, the fishes and the land animals will become like one another. I know my Miroir friends can talk to each other because I have heard them. They talk with their fins, the way we human beings talk with our mouths, and sometimes they use a language made up of smells, like a stream does when it's in spate.
My Miroir friends tell me that water is a living thing, and they say water is intelligent. When I tell them this they are amazed. How can a fish know such a thing, when it has never lived in the air and knows nothing of trees or the sounds of the land? I tell them the water's thoughts. The water thinks about itself all the time. Sometimes it makes noise, like a brook bubbling over rocks, or a sea storm whipping up the whitecaps into foam, and other times it is completely still, just a shimmering layer of life that covers all the land and all the sky, no more and no less than anything else, even our bodies. The water seems to know that if it stopped thinking and creating itself there would be no air for the birds, no food for the land animals, no sky for us fishes.
Some of my Miroir friends tell me that the living water thinks in sounds, which they can hear, and in thoughts, which they can not hear. They know that the water talks to itself in secret sounds that travel through the water as surely as light travels through air, but most fish have never learned to listen to the water's secret thoughts. "If only you could hear the water talking to itself you would know its secrets," my Miroir friends say. "You would know all that happens in the deep places of the sea. You would know the secrets of the Devil man, who is really your uncle and our father."
One day, when I was a little smaller and less careful of the other fishes'

For Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, there was a real concept of going into another dimension, with the characters encountering an entirely different set of rules and possibilities. But where did the film's concept of the wizarding convention come from? Was there something like that in the book? What sort of conventions are they?
As it turns out, author J.K. Rowling was the one who came up with the idea of magical convention. It was actually her who came up with the concept, so I'm glad that director Chris Columbus and the other filmmakers gave the concept a prominent place in the film. I remember that it was one of the standout moments from the film.
In the wizarding world, there are several conventions that people go to. Wizard's World is an organization that people belong to, and one of the advantages of this membership is getting a free ticket to conventions. According to the official Harry Potter website:
Its membership also includes the right to buy tickets to a number of Wizard’s World events – at a reduced price, of course. These events include the Wizard’s World Book Fair in London and the annual Wizard’s World Gathering at which all the biggest names in magic gather for an evening of dining, stargazing, concerts, and dancing (the traditional dance is the Lumos!).
So people do go to conventions, and wizarding conventions aren't all that different from conventions in the Muggle world. While they may be darker, there are still quite a few things in common, from role-playing games and cosplay, to guests and events. So it would make sense that people from the wizarding world would also be interested in going to conventions.
There were also two additional advantages to attending a wizarding convention that wouldn't make sense in a Muggle convention. They're allowed to use magic at conventions, and the spells and events that happen at the conventions are sanctioned by the Ministry of Magic, meaning that they won't attract the attention of the non-magical population.
According to the text of the book, Wizard's World's headquarters are located in the Alnwick Castle in England, so I wonder if Rowling made a pilgrimage to visit that castle, to take inspiration from it. The book says that Harry first becomes aware of the existence of a wizarding convention in the summer of 1992, when he overhears an elf giving his parents a brochure and talking about "the gathering" at the Wizard's World headquarters. It then jumps to the autumn of 1992, and the events of the book, and then at the end of the book, we jump back to the summer of 1993, and the events of the second book, and the wizarding world's gathering is taking place once more. This must've taken place again the next year in 1994, since Harry tells Dumbledore that he's supposed to be going to the gathering in 1995, in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. This hints that the gathering probably takes place on a regular schedule. This means that the gathering was taking place between 1992-94.
In the books, we get to see a lot of the different things that happen at the gathering. For one thing, they go to see a performance by Xenophilius Lovegood (Mr. Lovegood's son) in a secret tent in the garden. They have a holiday dinner (and it sounds like it's the only chance that they're allowed to have a holiday dinner during the year) in the Long Gallery, and the four principal characters go to see a wizarding rock concert. The artists performing are noted for being wild and dangerous, which is alluded to in the film, wherein Ron calls the concert "Sorcerer's Wristwatch." The book also mentions other performances, like the Carnival of Curiosities, which I could only imagine would be like a wizarding carnival or funfair.
So while there are a lot of things that can be played with in a film that takes place at a wizarding convention, it's a pity that we never got to see the majority of them. I know that there were a lot of other realities in the film, but since the chaos of the sorcerers that were introduced were so pivotal to the film, I wish they would've used some of this time to expand on some of the magic of the wizarding convention

One day a man from the hills ventured down the path, and was lost in the desert. A donkey once found was led to the mouth of the cave, but would not go in. Above the mouth of the cave were the words 'Here be dragons,' and nothing came out.
The sword lay within the cave where it had been buried, and the king was long dead. One by one they came to touch the metal, but they were not good men. Some came to take it, and some to sell it, and the sword did not wish to be taken.
The dragon slayer came to the cave and unlocked the treasure. In his dreams he had seen the sword lying upon the sands of the desert, and had wandered through the forest to find it. He took the sword from the ground and placed it in a velvet pouch, and then he slept.
He dreamed a second time of the palace, and wandered through the corridors of shadows until he came to a huge room where a throne of silver waited. He saw the king upon the throne, and heard a voice from the darkness say 'Go away, go away.'
There in the darkness lay the thief, stretched out on the stone, and the kingsman did not see him. The dragon slayer picked up the sword, and when he woke he found the room full of light.
Love could not take the sword to the princess, for love is the weakest of all the things. The gods, the dragon and the sword are stronger than love, and they were angry when they found what the princess had done. They had not seen this day before, and the dragon slayer was given the chance to take the sword and leave the world.
He was a young man then, and he looked at the sword in the pouch.
'I will take the sword and I will not leave the world,' he said, 'for this is the work of the king. If I do not take it then all that the king dreamed will be lost, and this thing cannot come to an end. I will take the sword and I will make an end of it.'
He drew the sword from the pouch and the sword was a child.
'Forgive me,' he said, 'but I have no choice.'
Then he touched the sword with his hand, and the blade rose into the air to strike the man, and with one mighty blow he killed the thief.
This was a new thing, and the dragon slayer did not know what to do. He sheathed the sword in the pouch, and he tried to see what had happened, but he could not.
He carried the sword back to the castle, and hid it in his room beneath a thick layer of blankets. The dragon slayer was a young man then, and no one would ever dream that he was the man who had saved the kingdom.
The king's son was lost, and the people of the land were confused. They did not know if the kingdom had truly been saved or if it had fallen, for they had never seen the sword. They asked the dragon slayer to go down to the beach where the ship had been wrecked.
The king sent a great fleet with him, and they anchored off the beach where the ruined ship lay upon the sand. The dragon slayer climbed the cliff above the ship and began to walk back towards the castle. They met him as he reached the castle. He took the sword from beneath the blankets, and waved the sword before his face.
The sword turned into a fox, and the dragon slayer could see it was his friend. He turned to the people, and the crowd began to fall to their knees. The king's son woke from his sleep, and went to take the sword.
The people saw the sword move from the dragon slayer's hand, and they fell back and wept. They saw the sword change and they knew it was their friend, and they wondered if they had been saved.
The dragon slayer sheathed the sword, and his friend leaped to his shoulder. The dragon slayer walked into the king's chamber, and the king smiled when he saw his son.
They knelt beside the dragon slayer and spoke to the sword in his hand.
'Tell us,' the king said.
'I was walking along the desert, and I saw a cave in the sand. I went inside and found you, my friend. I took you from the cave and slew the dragon.'
'Where is your companion?'

It included the screening of a documentary about Spanish artist Luis Buñuel and a dramatic reading of French writer Michel Butor’s “Late November,” the second installment of the ongoing series, “The Drama of the Muse.” Afterward, a traditional “cup of tea” ceremony was held for the opening, and the museum’s board of directors presented the artists with their respective prizes.
The new museum is located in a former mechanic’s shop and is part of a renovation project that will add three floors of permanent and temporary exhibition space, as well as a new outdoor terrace. The grand opening is the latest step in the museum’s 50-year history. It is also part of a broader plan to revitalize the 2.7-acre museum campus and its 170,000 square feet of exhibition space.
The new building will be adjacent to the existing exhibition building and the future site of the Harwood’s Art Museum. The new building will add more than 40,000 square feet of space to the existing museum campus. The new building will be a larger space and will be designed to house more artworks than the current museum building.
The museum campus has been undergoing a major expansion, which began in 2006 and is on track to be completed in 2017. The new building is expected to add more than 100,000 square feet of exhibition space. The Harwood also plans to build a new parking garage that will provide 3,000 parking spaces. The new building will be an important addition to the Harwood’s campus, and is expected to bring new visitors to the museum.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,464 - Generated text:  are unquestionably Indian in origin. The symbols include: a collection of animals (the “Sun Dagger”), a spiral (the “Wall Moth”) and a circular image that is frequently likened to a flying saucer (the “Maze”). Scientists have not been able to identify the symbols but they are a mystery.
What a blast that would be! We think we should know more about the symbols, they are cool and kinda mysterious and that is pretty neat.
It is interesting to note that some of the carvings are on weathered rock and others are on still-smooth rock. There are some that appear to be recently made while others are several hundred years old. It is also interesting to note that these are the only rock carvings found in the entire area that seems to have no other purpose than to provide something for humans to look at. Why would humans be attracted to them if they were not so very old?
The venerable Archaeological Institute of America has identified 39 distinct “glyphs” but it is also not known exactly what they mean. According to the National Park Service, “There is no significant pattern and the rocks are difficult to interpret, even with the benefit of our 21st-century technology”.
Considering how much effort was put forth by all the Americans who believed that the Indians were a lost tribe of Israel, this is a mystery that will remain a mystery until they figure out what the ancients intended.
In the mean time, you can go to Bryce Canyon and look at the carvings and decide for yourself what you think they mean.
If you are looking for a location to buy property, it seems reasonable to look for property close to some of these “mysteries” as they are a great attraction and should add value to your property.
Real Estate “mysteries” include any mystery that may cause buyers to think that property is different from what it is. Among those mysteries would be natural “phenomena” like secluded waterfalls or a hiking trail to a cave. I have done a blog post on the 8 reasons why a property with a cave should be avoided. A well known example of a property with an underground cavern that has not been a good investment is Bridalveil Falls in Yosemite Valley. The property that surrounds the falls is very nice and at a premium price. You can read a blog post on the property here.
A property that is adjacent to a natural rock formation is another good reason to consider buying property. I have owned property adjacent to a massive rock formation in Lake Elsinore, CA called the Pinnacle.
Again, a look at the image to the right will reveal that this huge rock formation is not only a mystery, it has “officially” been ruled out as being from “natural” causes.
Rock carvings are much easier to do now than when they were done in 400 B.C. so any property that has rock carvings, like the ones pictured here in this blog, can still be easily identified as having been done by ancient people.
All this being said, it should be pointed out that the main reason to buy property is to have a place to live. It should also be pointed out that you don’t need a mystery to buy a property that is a great investment.
Atlantic City Boardwalk Stripped
Here’s another interesting story from the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Apparently this has been ongoing for a while and is now coming to a head.
The photographer was able to take the pictures by climbing through a fence into an abandoned parking lot. The images, obtained by CBS New York, show the eroded boardwalk of the city that was once the hub of East Coast gambling.
The reason why the boardwalk is being demolished is that it has deteriorated so severely that it is not safe. Obviously the government is not going to build a new boardwalk to look like the old boardwalk and then open it up to bathers.
Ironically, before this incident the tourism industry was in such bad shape that the area of the boardwalk that they tore out was a place where a lot of the people who were into blackjack, craps and other casino games didn’t want to be. The last time I was there it was a dirty, messy place. It was a place where the homeless people went.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,464 - Generated text:  it. – Edwin Bissell
Along with needing (and wanting) guidance on how to get there, many of us are often searching for the perfect travel companion to go with us on our adventures. If you are in the latter boat, look no further.
The incredible, magnificent, beautiful, and absolutely drop dead gorgeous Carrire Valley, NM is home to the oldest restaurant in New Mexico and one of the most notorious in the country.
Known as The Peacock Room, this quaint and tiny restaurant is located along the historic Route 66 between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Unlike other restaurants that offer a menu that only changes once a month, The Peacock Room menu is one of the few that remains unchanged throughout the year. The majority of their menu is meat with additional choices for vegetarians (or those who think they’re being vegetarian). On the rare occasion that the fried egg is out of season (fried eggs are served every day), you can opt to get the soft scrambled eggs. Yes, it’s an awesome thing.
The Peacock Room has been around for as long as I can remember. It’s the type of place that you expect to see the only known man in black (Johnny Cash) eating at on one of his many visits to Albuquerque. In fact, Cash requested to have a seating area where he could smoke cigars. After his death, a plaque was placed above the smoking section with a quote that reads, “When I die, just throw dirt in my eye.”
It is important to note that The Peacock Room is a family establishment. Therefore, it is not uncommon for women to be wearing bras and men to be eating with their shirts off. Now if that isn’t a magical adventure, I’m not sure what is.
Nearby spots for sightseeing and exploration
Montezuma Castle & Twin Rocks
Less than an hour away from The Peacock Room in Montezuma Castle National Monument, you can find “Jumbo Rock” and “Miniature Rock”. You are also only a few miles away from the Tin Lizard sculptures in Springerville, Arizona. These sculptures were created from 1975 until 1995 by a gentleman named Wayne D. Staley. While the sculptures are impressive and a must see, there are a few things to be aware of if you choose to visit. First, the roads leading to the sculptures are dirt and therefore can be a bit treacherous. Second, some of the sculptures are located down abandoned mine shafts, so it is highly recommended that you stay on the established path.
The perfect jumping off point for the magnificent Petrified Forest National Park. There you can find all kinds of dried up trees as well as some petrified mammals and, of course, petrified wood.
For those looking to travel further and into another state, why not go to the Winslow, AZ.
The aforementioned city in Arizona has a rich history in many ways, including the music of the Eagles. Yes, the very song “Take It Easy” was created from Winslow’s “Standin’ on the corner”. The historic Old Trail Hotel is another notable stop to make while you’re in the area.
Only a few miles from the Peacock Room, here you can find some of the most beautiful wildlife this side of the Mississippi River. Be sure to bring your camera for this one. Also, pay attention to the turn when driving through the mountain because the roads are super curvy.
The perfect stop for coffee, desserts, or anything really. Frijoles and Tamales Cafe has what they call “Milagro con Café” which is cold coffee and milk with a special sugar. It’s delicious and amazing. Just trust me.
Shopping District in Old Town
No trip to Santa Fe would be complete without a stop to the popular Southwestern-style plaza, which has been home to many Native American shops, crafts and art galleries since the 1820s. If you have the time and would like to walk around a bit, be sure to check out the surrounding shops.
The best thing about trips is that they are always an adventure. Some times are better than others, but if you are open and in the moment, you can enjoy every little thing that comes your way. In the case of The Peacock Room, the beautiful scenery of the surrounding area makes the meal even more special.

I went to the door and tried the handle, it was unlocked, it had to be unlocked when it locked itself. I snuck out of the room, curious to know what was going on. It was quiet, almost too quiet, but then, this was an old house, that’s why it was cheaper, right? But then there’s the sound of a washroom flushing, it had to be on the first floor, the sound of footsteps, so it was the second floor, then I felt a tap on my shoulder. I froze in my tracks, turned around, but it was only the dead-eyed dog, hair matted, rotting teeth, and snarling with broken gums. My knees buckled as I put my hands in front of me and ran blindly.
I fell over an empty beer keg and landed in a pile of mud, washing the last of my curiosity away. I wanted to run away, to scream my head off. But no, that wouldn’t help me, would it? I’d end up a goop on the floor. But what could have happened? Did the dog come for me? Or, it could be a member of the family, the maid, the cook, one of the servants, I had to think positive. The sun was setting as I lay there, looking up at the sky, wondering what was going on. I know I should have screamed and banged on the door to show how much of a good samaritan I was, but I couldn’t, I was too scared.
I stood up and tried to retrace my footsteps, but with no other clues, I couldn’t. I retraced my steps and decided to stay in my room.
I called room service for tea, a light one, and went to my room, a secluded one in the far end of the house. I was in the mood for some self-indulgent time, so I tried meditating for a bit. No thoughts, no worries, nothing. No meditating, no worries, and no empty beer kegs, that was what happened. I was sure of it.
I heard a series of sounds that gave me goose bumps. The door creaking open and then shut, footsteps, clicking fingers and a cough. I heard the creak of the door, and someone asking for tea. It could be my imagination, but I always feared that I would have to share my accommodations with other family members. If it were any other family, I wouldn’t have minded sharing, but that one from here was not one that I would have wanted to share anything with, including that room service tea. I was going to pounce on them when they came in, and that’s what I did, when they brought the tea, a mug for each of us. But my pouncing was too premature as I tried to pounce when the person sat on my bed, except, it wasn’t a person, and it wasn’t my bed, and it wasn’t my room.
It was a cobwebbed room, and the walls were covered with pictures of the family – the only one in the frame was of a young girl with long, dark hair. I felt a cold clammy feeling in my throat as I stared at the photo, confused. I heard footsteps, and this time I ran out, tripped over something, and landed in a pile of mud. I lay there, hands on my head, gasping for breath, looking up at the sky. No, it couldn’t have been. I knew it wasn’t. I couldn’t have had another life, I mean, it was a dream, after all, right?
I walked out of the room, my head whirring. It was creepy, a little scary. I walked out of the room, through the corridors and stairs, and I saw a rat scamper away. I shook my head and continued. I was almost to the foyer when I tripped over an object and fell on the floor. I got up and rubbed my head, thanking God that it was still daytime and nobody could see me. It was just an empty beer keg. My God, I had to calm down. I couldn’t afford to be paranoid

By 2035, the world’s commercial air traffic is expected to double in size. The sector is now expanding rapidly with passenger demand reaching new heights. To keep pace, the aviation sector is focused on ways to increase efficiency.
“Electrification of aircraft is on the rise. It has the potential to open up a whole new world for air travel. Airlines want to connect and unlock new markets, reduce the environmental impact of air transport, and enhance the travel experience for passengers,” said Jean Botti, Airbus Chief Technology Officer.
With commercial air travel expected to more than double by 2035, it is vital that the aviation sector rethinks how it delivers to travelers. Key focus areas include the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), electric propulsion and the digital transformation of aircraft.

We take a look at the development of these three essential elements.
Reducing the impact on the environment
Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) – essentially a blend of regular jet fuel with alternative energy sources – have been around for some time, but their importance is becoming more recognized, particularly within the industry.
“When we look at the next generation of aircraft, one thing is clear: reducing environmental impact is a top priority for the aviation industry,” explained Dirk Hoke, CEO at Airbus Defense and Space.
While conventional jet fuel represents more than 70% of all aviation fuel consumed, manufacturers such as Airbus are developing new innovative alternatives. SAF is part of the solution to decarbonizing aviation as it offers lower life-cycle emissions than traditional fuels, reducing its overall environmental impact.
“We have already been testing SAFs for more than 10 years,” added Jean Botti. “What we can say is that SAF is a very promising technology.”
Airbus is using sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in a series of test flights. Image: Airbus
Using new technologies to create electric propulsion systems
Electric propulsion systems aim to improve the efficiency of aircraft operations by replacing traditional fuel-based propulsion systems with an electrical motor. However, unlike conventional engines, they will also need a re-think of the role that the aircraft plays in the supply chain.
The potential of electric propulsion systems could result in more environmentally friendly operations, coupled with new and better experiences for passengers.
“This kind of propulsion is part of our flight demonstrator project for electric flight, that we are working on with the French authorities,” explained Jean Botti.

Flying above the clouds with passengers seated upright
Until now, low-cost airlines have only provided basic amenities to passengers. In an effort to reduce costs, and keep the journey experience economical, they often allow little time for seating.
However, there are signs that an industry-wide shift towards creating more value for passengers could be imminent.
“Travel is changing, with an increasingly significant share of travelers coming from the young, mobile workforce,” explained Jean Botti. “People have much more to spend, and they are increasingly demanding more of their travel experiences.”
The forecast is that by 2035, more than one in four people will travel by plane every year, providing the opportunity to capitalize on more demand. To do so, more attractive, quality-focused and personalized services are required.

A new form of propulsion is also coming into the mix. Airbus is working on hybrid and electric aircraft that will allow passengers to travel more comfortably.
“This could also have a very significant impact on noise abatement around airports, allowing us to take aircraft into areas where we can’t go today,” added Jean Botti.
Airbus has more than 100 aircraft in service today with some form of hybrid propulsion system – from large aircraft such as the A380, through to small regional aircraft like the A320 Neo family.
Leveraging new technologies
At the heart of any new revolution in aviation are the people who are prepared to design, manufacture and develop technologies that re-im

2024-09-25 03:22:14,464 - Generated text:  daily life: voices shouting from stalls, bartering, shuffling of fruits and vegetables, and the persistent buzz of bees. At the very center of the marketplace was a towering stack of produce.
An elderly man sat nearby, sketching the stack with great detail. He had a penchant for drawing elaborate perspectives and was known by some as the “Perspective King”. His sight was not what it once was. To compensate, he had begun drawing what he saw in his mind’s eye. He would carefully take a sketch, then observe the reality of the picture. If the two didn’t match, he would erase the one he’d drawn, and draw again.
On this day, a shrewd merchant spotted him. He approached with a proposal to produce a sketch of the stack as well as a shiny red apple sitting on top of it. The merchant’s proposal included a chance to win the apple at the end of the drawing. The proposal sounded absurd to the old man. Yet the challenge drew him in.
The sketch would take months to complete. But the old man agreed, and was excited to begin the work. He began drawing the stack, noting each twist of the branches and the shape of the apples. Then he added the fine details: crevices, knots, and the colors of the leaves. When the old man was finally finished, he laid down his charcoal, then sat in contemplation. He thought of the sketch as a puzzle piece to the stack’s reality. It was up to him to figure out how to make them fit together.
At first the old man had fun with it, playing around with the towering stack until he saw how they matched. But, gradually he started to tense. He noticed that the old man had a habit of adjusting his sketch slightly. The old man had developed an obsessive compulsion to draw every single twist and bend of the apple as it sat atop the stack.
He became so disoriented, that his sketch no longer reflected reality. It had become a false reality of his own creation. Then the old man became overwhelmed. The stack seemed to start spinning and suddenly became fuzzy. And then the old man felt his sight fading away.
There is a lesson to be learned from the old man’s dilemma. Whenever we start drawing, and find ourselves too focused on the work, it can cause us to lose sight of the bigger picture. It can be overwhelming to try to capture every detail. And when we obsess over our sketches, we can forget that our work is meant to reflect the truth, not create it. The old man believed his sketch was truth, but it was not. He allowed his sketch to become more important than the reality.
When we begin work, or create a project of any kind, it is important to focus on the details without forgetting the purpose. To complete a project successfully, you must focus on the full reality of the work. Without this approach, your work is simply a sketch of the original.

How to not be a Martyr
I am not a martyr. When I choose to surrender, I choose to live a more peaceful and easier life. But when I’m walking around like a zombie, pretending I don’t have a problem, when I’m making the assumption that everyone is holding me back, or that everyone is just out to get me, then I’m a martyr. I’ve got to put my feet back on the ground. When I surrender, I get in touch with the real me. The real me that is set free from the fear and the hate.
I’m thinking about my daughter recently, who was on the verge of being a martyr. She’s living with a chronic illness, has a mentally unstable mother, and a few years ago her life was pretty chaotic. She’s strong, and she has the will to keep living. But that’s not all she has. She has a supportive family. A loving and involved dad. And I know that when she thinks she’s feeling sorry for herself, and everyone is against her, it’s just that she’s lost perspective of the greater world. And she has something I haven’t yet learned to appreciate.
I know my life is different. I have a beautiful family, and it’s hard to believe in a universe where I’ve got so much. My life has never been a struggle. And when I started, it didn’t look like it would ever be. My life is a blessing, and I’m grateful everyday for all that

But when he returns a grown man to reclaim his crown, he is opposed by a psychotic despot—and beloved by a mysterious princess. Torn between duty and love, torn between a throne and a saber, torn between two worlds and two lives, the boy must finally decide…to be king or to be a warrior. —Publisher’s description

In the face of overwhelming evil, a hero must choose to fight or to live. An unassuming, troubled boy, whose mission is to kill the tyrant that rules over the people he loves. Will he find his strength or lose his soul to a pointless revenge? The writing is simple, but the characters are strong and well developed. Unlike many other books with this kind of story, the author introduces the reader to the main character at a young age, which gives the reader the opportunity to see his character evolve through the course of the book. Although the ending does not end all of the conflicts, there are a few loose ends, but those left were handled adequately. My one critique for this book is that the dialogue was extremely stilted at times, it almost sounded more like a screenplay than dialogue. This is not a typical book for me, but it will be worth reading for a good story with a surprising ending.

Suspense and action from beginning to end. The adventure of an ancient battle and mystery. I was drawn in by the cliffhanger ending that made me want to know what happens next.
The characters in this book are well developed and will keep you intrigued throughout the book. It is a fantastic read that is worth the time. I love the attention to detail the author put into this book. I am anxious to see what else he comes up with.

Wow. I think this is a story that will resonate with many of us. I found it hard to put down. I really liked the message at the end. There's a lesson to be learned here for our current world situation.
This book tells the story of a boy who becomes a man who is faced with the dilemma of becoming a hero or a villain. The twist is that he is supposed to be the villain but the fate of mankind and his own soul are on the line. Very quick read and an interesting one.

Great concept for a book. It seemed to jump around a bit too much for me, but that is mainly my personal preference. I still really enjoyed the story and plan to read more from this author.
Asari Aug 04, 2014
This was a great book and will appeal to both men and women readers alike. Ancient myth and intrigue keep the story moving while the age old struggle between doing what you think is right or doing what is necessary for your own survival plays out over centuries in the minds of the main characters. It is the hero that we wish to see.

“And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads” (Rev 12:3).
The ancient Bible talks about a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns. The ten horns represent power and the seven heads represent different regions. They are also symbolic of the seven kingdoms that replaced the Roman Empire in the Middle East.
This passage in Revelation refers to the seven heads as the ancient Empire of Rome, the Western Roman Empire, Eastern Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Italy. It also refers to the seven kings in Daniel’s visions. Some critics say that this verse is about the seven mountains of Rome, but it doesn’t talk about a mountain; rather, it’s about a dragon and its power.
The seven heads of the dragon represent different kingdoms and they’re described as “red,” “bloody,” and “having seven crowns upon his heads.” The seven heads also represent seven mountains. These mountains include Jerusalem, Mount Zion, Lebanon, Mount Sion, and Mushroom Mountain.
Some people say that the seven mountains are a symbol of seven mountains in the Bible. The Bible says that the seven mountains are called a beast (Isaiah 27:1), a leopard (Daniel 8:2), and a lion (Daniel 7:4). The seven mountains also represent the seven world empires.
In Revelation, the seven mountains are called the “dragon.” This dragon was symbolic of the Roman Empire and was referred to as the “beast.”
The seven mountains of Rome represent the seven stages of the Roman Empire. These stages include the First World War, the Second World War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Battle of Britain, the War on Terror, and the New World Order.
“And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born” (Rev 12:3-4).
The ancient Bible talks about a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns. The ten horns represent power and the seven heads represent different regions. They are also symbolic of the seven kingdoms that replaced the Roman Empire in the Middle East.
The dragon’s ten horns represent the seven great powers of the world.
“And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent” (Rev 12:6).

Wren arrives at the magical, isolated estate of Dragon's Teeth, eager for an escape from her dreary life. It is the home of Lucas, her childhood friend who is crippled by a tragic accident and now lives like a prisoner. When the mysterious Lucian arrives to take her on as his apprentice, Wren jumps at the chance to learn from him and proves herself a quick study. It is a dream come true.
The other students at the school are hostile, but Wren senses that they envy her. Something is wrong. As Lucas's behavior becomes more aggressive and violent, Lucian is the only one she can turn to. Yet his feelings toward her confuse her, and not everyone shares his interest.
When a deadly threat is revealed, Lucas's dark side comes to light. Now Wren must fight him for control and protect the mysterious kingdom hidden within her dreams before they disappear.
This is the first novel in the Dreamwalker series, the story of a young girl's path to power.

The Experimental Fear of Rejection and the Uncanny Valleys of Uncommon Friends
The 2015 film Rejection has become one of the most talked-about and divisive movies of the past year, generating a wide spectrum of reactions from those who have seen it, from enthrallment to horror to confusion. In this piece, I will explore the film’s themes and motifs, particularly the symbolism of its title, the concept of “rejection” as a catalyst for change, and the film’s exploration of the uncanny valleys of uncommon friendship.
A closer look at the film’s title reveals that it is a play on the word “rejection,” and suggests that it is a more accurate description of the film’s content than the title might suggest. Rejection is a title that seems to be more about accepting rejection and understanding its role in the story rather than being a straightforward synopsis. It is also a play on the idea of a rejection, which is a central motif in the film.
The concept of “rejection” is a powerful theme in Rejection, as it is the catalyst for change. The protagonist, a young boy named Martin, is constantly being rejected by his peers and family, and it is this rejection that leads to his eventual transformation into a powerful monster. Throughout the film, Martin is shown to be a sensitive, emotionally vulnerable boy who is overwhelmed by the rejections he receives. This is not the only time “rejection” is used in the film; in one scene, the protagonist’s mother tells him that he is “too sensitive” and that he needs to “grow a thicker skin.” This is also a sign of the protagonist’s eventual transformation.
The uncanny valley is an often-used term to describe the discomfort some people feel when they look at digital representations of real-life objects or people. In Rejection, the protagonist’s transformation into a monster is one of the most powerful moments in the film. The uncanny valley can be seen as a sign of the protagonist’s psychological transformation and an indication that the film is moving towards a more allegorical meaning.
The concept of friendship is also important in Rejection, as the protagonist is faced with an increasingly difficult task of trying to form new friendships with his peers. The film’s exploration of the uncanny valleys of uncommon friendship is perhaps the most telling part of the film’s story. The protagonist’s transformation into a monster is the ultimate act of rejection, and this rejection is also a catalyst for his eventual transformation into a more powerful form of himself.
Rejection is a complex and thought-provoking film that examines the themes of rejection, the uncanny valleys of uncommon friendship, and the concept of “rejection” as a catalyst for change. The film’s exploration of these themes is a powerful and moving experience, and it is one of the most unique films of 2015.

Are these ancient treasure hunters hiding a secret, or does the ancient treasure contain a secret? This quest and others in the line of lost treasure are chronicled by Dirk Pitt and his wife and sidekick, Dana. This installment also introduces Al Giordino, and his own quest for the treasure of an ancient African ruler. He brings a balance to the romance and adventure of Pitt and his wife.

It is the first book I've read by this author and I was very pleased with it. It will be a little confusing at first but it gets better and you'll find that the characters are not quite what they seem.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,465 - Prompt 90: The annual meeting of the League of Extraordinarily Shy Superheroes, where the main event is
2024-09-25 03:22:14,465 - Generated text:  an award given out to the superhero who’s been doing the most charity work over the past year. This year’s winner is MegaMan X (from X3’s subtitle). MegaMan goes off to celebrate and has to deal with the Evil in his past, which has been recreated as a villainous version of X (from X4’s subtitle).
Those are pretty simple, but those synopses combine into an incredibly complicated plot that unfolds over the course of the game. The plot isn’t the main reason to play the game though; the action is the main draw. There’s a lot of fighting with Robot Masters and some of their successors, some which make an appearance in X8.
It’s a terrific game, full of incredibly awesome set pieces, weird twists, and interesting characters. In fact, MegaMan X8 is considered one of the best in the series. It’s also considered one of the hardest though.
X8 is a little unforgiving in that regard. It doesn’t punish you as much for dying in the first seven games (and their spin-offs), but it’s still frustrating at times. Still, in my opinion, it’s worth dealing with that frustration. X8 is fun to play, it’s got terrific music, and it’s just plain cool.
Raiden X is a promotional game for the 2006 Raiden game for the PS2. It was made by a different developer than the one that made X8, and plays more like an X game, just with different characters.
I had actually downloaded this game about two years ago to play the first time around, but decided to finally give it a try on the eve of its re-release for the PS3, the Playstation Vita, and Xbox 360. As you might imagine, being a long time fan of X (well, MegaMan X really), I was pretty excited to finally play it. I was also pretty disappointed.
Too bad the actual game isn’t all that great.
I’m not saying it’s bad by any means, but it’s not as great as I’d hoped it would be. In fact, it doesn’t really do anything especially interesting with the idea of a MegaMan X spin-off. It has the style of X8, but a game with an older MegaMan fighting X games Robot Masters. That could be fun, but it’s not.
In fact, it could almost be described as a throwback to the first six X games in the sense that it plays like those. It’s an X game, just with a less impressive soundtrack, less satisfying combat, and less interesting bosses and level designs.
If it’s the only way to play the game, that’s fine, but for a game like this, which was so clearly made to capitalize on the MegaMan X franchise, it’s not really that good. I mean, you’re not going to care about any of the characters or backstories, and the combat is really kind of bland. That’s a shame, since Raiden X is a great game to look at. It’s not a disaster by any means, but it’s one of the disappointing games I’ve played this year.
I really enjoyed MegaMan X8. Raiden X is decent enough, but not really that great. If it were the only way to play MegaMan X, I’d be a lot more forgiving of it. But, fortunately, there’s another way.
X9 is a game that takes everything that made X8 so good, and improves on it. That’s what I was hoping for when I decided to revisit MegaMan X8 and was so disappointed by Raiden X, and X9 was what I got.
Without spoiling anything, X9 takes the fun parts of X8, improves on them, and then adds a ton of new features that work so well together to create a game that is not only a fantastic sequel to X8, but one of the best in the franchise. It’s as good as X8 is in every way, and it’s got a lot more content. The levels are great, the enemies are more varied and challenging, the music is fantastic, the writing is a lot better, and the bosses are incredibly fun.
And let me say that it’s great to have MegaMan X back, even if he’s a little different this time. He’s not just the same dude from X8, he’s actually

Dylan Brown was born on July 15, 1982 in North Hills, California, USA. He is a writer and producer, known for Scooby-Doo! & KISS: Rock and Roll Mystery (2015), Green Eggs and Ham (2019) and Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans (2019).
Robert Rodriguez is a director, screenwriter and producer born in San Antonio, Texas, whose films blend the surfaces of children's entertainment with the qualities of stylish, at times transgressive adult fare. His Mexican descent, Roman Catholic background and disregard for the social issues of the world make his best works fablelike narratives peopled by bandits, kids and wild animals. For his audiences, this means a bracing combination of the colorful, the surreal, the grotesque and the innocent, held together by breathless action sequences. Rodriguez was born on June 20, 1968, in San Antonio, the youngest of seven children born to Rebecca Vivas, an artist, and Gustavo Rodriguez, who worked in machine shops. Gustavo and Rebecca divorced when their son was 3, and the future director lived with his mother. She was a strict Catholic, and her son remembers that he was grounded for a time when he went to a movie by himself. Rodriguez claims that his mother wouldn't let him see Star Wars (1977) until his father-who had already seen it 20 times-forgave her for what she had done to him. However, his first exposure to the film was even worse, when he and his mother were attending a double feature with Jaws (1975) and were accidentally caught in the middle of Star Wars. She thought the movie was a Nazi flick, and had no idea until the feature ended. Rodriguez was 11, and the film soon became an obsession. He loved the look of it, the sweeping scenes and the grandeur of the space battles. Rodriguez decided that he wanted to become a filmmaker. To that end, he worked on his own films at a young age. At age 10, he made a short 8 mm comedy called El Superamigos (1978). The success of Star Wars led to his first feature-length work, Bedheads (1987), a surreal 17-minute sci-fi comedy. With a soundtrack by The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Bedheads is a typical 1950s stereotype of the clash of generations. A rift develops between a group of aliens who came to Earth to study human hairdressing and an adolescent boy who adheres to the hair-fashion ideals of the 1950s. The boy goes on a crusade to stop the aliens from creating "squares" among the Earthlings. The film won the student film award from the Society of Independent Motion Pictures and earned Rodriguez the first of his 11 Student Academy Awards, this one for directing. By 1988, Rodriguez had formed his production company, Troublemaker Studios, and was continuing to make his own films. In 1990, he completed the short film Planet Terror (1992). Also in 1990, the young filmmaker shot El Mariachi (1992), the film that would make him a worldwide director of note. It is not the most memorable of movies, as it is, essentially, a prototype of the Spaghetti Western. But the film became famous because Rodriguez made it for $7,000 in five weeks in his hometown. It had a roadshow theatrical release, and gained a strong cult following on VHS. In 1993, Rodriguez took his sudden fame and launched a career. The first full-length film he made, and his first theatrical release, was a grisly kids' tale called Elm Street Nightmare (1991). Rodriguez didn't direct this one, but he had learned to edit on a computer. So he edited the feature himself, using Adobe After Effects, and thereby turned an unsavory if decent-enough B-grade slasher picture into an explosion of colorful, fast-cut special effects. Also in 1993, he completed a horror

The silver willow swayed in rhythm to the breeze and seemed to be of the same insubstantial material as its surroundings. Together, the two fused as one, creating an ethereal vision in the early morning sun. As the light cast a golden glow on the willow, the branches were emblazoned in purple. The entire scene resembled that of the gates of heaven, conjured from the works of man. No less spectacular was the impenetrable veil of water that reflected the heavenly luminescence. The clouds cast in white, seemed to be a heavenly descent to waft along the sky.
As you continue to read the description, you might imagine that you are on the set of a David Lynch film, but you are mistaken. As with many compositions in the realm of eremitism, the author is humble.
It was neither in a heavenly trance nor a magic vision. The reality of the scene has not been obscured, although it has been simply made to look unrealistic, for the sake of making a beautiful picture.
What I hope to convey to the reader is that the art of the monk's tranquility is a skill that he learns to develop over many years. Like a fine Italian chef learning the basics of cooking, a monk must learn how to put pen to paper, or on the more modern front, how to capture the image on a screen.
Upon reading this book, it is my hope that you can make pictures like these. However, I must warn you that this is a very difficult thing to do. When I began in the world of photography, I quickly became interested in both nature and aerial photography. My mother was a large proponent of bird watching. She often took her binoculars along on her rides and often commented on the beauty of the wilderness and its inhabitants. She was especially fond of birds, so when she gave me my first binoculars, I was extremely excited and my first few trips in the woods to use them was an utter delight. At first I only saw the trees, but soon my eyes were opened to the various and interesting inhabitants of the wild. I spent many a day in those woods, noting the small differences in the size, and the behavior of these animal. I found a great interest in birds and became convinced that I wanted to be a bird photographer. I eventually invested in a better pair of binoculars and finally, a good camera. A few years later, I bought my first camera. Since I had experience as a photo journalist, I chose the Canon Digital Rebel, which had a great reputation for not only its ability to capture sharp and clear pictures, but also its ease of use. I did not learn all the complicated and technical aspects of photography at once. In fact, it took me almost two years before I felt as if I knew all of the most essential aspects. However, I do not claim to be the worlds most knowledgable photographer. I am merely a hobbyist who does not know all that much about the art, but have at least found a way to produce good quality pictures.
I have chosen to begin this book with a description of a sunset because I believe it is the one image most easy to understand. The autumn sunset, the most common feature in the work of a skilled photographer, is one that is widely respected by millions of people. We have come to view this image as a masterpiece, but the truth is that most do not possess the skills to actually capture such a masterpiece. While the subject of this book, photography, has received much praise and respect, many do not understand the intricacies of this art form. In this book, I hope to answer the questions "What makes a good picture?" and "How do I make a picture like that?".
It is difficult to say what makes a good photograph, or even how to define what makes a good picture. A picture can be any number of things. It can be a picture of a person, a landscape, or something in between. But no matter what type of picture is being made, there are many factors that make a picture of the world a great picture. For the sake of making this guide clear and helpful to readers, I will try to put it in simple terms.
I don't want to discourage you, but I do want to make it clear that you can be as good at photography as you want to be. The problem is that there are thousands of photographers who claim to be great photographers, but many don't have the knowledge to back up

Whilst there’s an undeniable beauty to the scene of a decaying civilisation, there’s nothing quite like the beauty of a healthy one. Let’s begin at the beginning.
The closest city to Lake Chapala, Guadalajara is the heart of Jalisco and the second largest city in Mexico.
As you drive out of Guadalajara, the crowded streets melt away and you’re left in a serene countryside filled with fields of red and yellow flowers.
A family on a motorbike rides past the monstera deliciosa plant.
One of the first signs of Lake Chapala is the emergence of fluffy cotton-candy clouds hanging on the horizon.
Everyone at Lake Chapala knows the gate by the man who can often be found stationed behind it, nodding in the sunshine. He’s been there for as long as we’ve been living here, and everyone calls him Bruno.
As the sun sets, men in t-shirts are seen fixing barbed wire in a small garden beside the road.
There’s an art to playing chess; the countryside gives the scene a sense of peace.
It seems like every town in Mexico has a park.
As the road dips in and out of the mountains, the scenery changes from small farms and modest homes to elaborate haciendas and steep canyon walls.
A Mexican flag waves lazily in the warm breeze on an adobe home.
The sunset glows against the rocky face of the mountains.
A beautiful structure sits hidden in the hills.
The view from the middle of a dry lake bed.
Mexico City is a car-dependent city, with endless miles of bumper to bumper traffic. When you’re in the middle of the metropolis, it’s easy to forget just how vast and beautiful the countryside is beyond the city limits.
Every bend of the mountain road brings a new perspective and new surprises.
It’s hard to imagine now, but in the not too distant past, the majority of Mexico’s population lived in the countryside. Now, 70% of the population lives in the cities.
A road uncovered by the encroaching jungle weaves through the canyons.
Houses, farms and villas sit hidden in the jungle.
Rosita hammocks are a popular symbol around Lake Chapala.
The sun dances across the mountains.
Old houses and peeling billboards line the mountain roads.
Potholes and dirt roads slow traffic, as the driver navigates each hole and dip.
Even in the countryside, the scars of the past remain. The memory of these abandoned villages will forever hang over the countryside.
Hopi gets the best out of every bend, chasing shadows and taking in every bit of nature on the way.
The view from the very top of a mountain is like nothing else, with the wind cooling you, the sun warming your face and the sky full of colour.
We won’t be living in Mexico forever, but every time we go home to visit, there’s something that’s just so inspiring about this country. In the countryside, there’s a depth to Mexico’s beauty that you just don’t see in the cities. Every day is a small adventure, with something interesting waiting around every bend.
And the best bit? There’s no pesos in sight!
Who doesn’t love vintage photography?
We are LOVING Mexico! Looks like an absolutely stunning place – we’ll be there in two weeks… exciting!
Thanks so much, Chris! How long are you staying for?
Wow! The pictures of the countryside make me want to pack my bags and head down there. It looks and sounds amazing! I’ve spent a few weeks in Guadalajara and it was great!
Thanks, Karly! I totally love it here, especially the countryside. Are you planning on visiting Mexico anytime soon?
I am! I am planning to go to the Yucatan Peninsula for a few weeks and then move to the Pacific coast to teach English.
What an interesting concept for a blog! Congratulations! And I love your photos!
Ah, thanks so much for your kind words! I’m glad you like the photos too!

2024-09-25 03:22:14,466 - Generated text:  1974, when the progressive rock band Emerson Lake and Palmer recorded a single titled "Fanfare for the Common Man," inspired by the classic works of legendary American composer, Aaron Copland. Aaron Copland is celebrated throughout the world as one of America's greatest composers. Mr. Copland, a Yankee through and through, made it his mission in life to write a symphony for the common man, a grand sweeping tune of the breadth and width of the vast American landscape. This nationalist sentiment could not have found a better vehicle for expression than the symphonic form, itself a creation of the common man, the common musician.
Listen to this work in the first movement, and in that rich array of musical ideas and sensations, and you will hear the soul of the American wilderness. This is what you can listen for on our hike into the wilderness in search of Aaron Copland. This is what you will find out there, in those lonely hills and valleys, among those giant pines, that you can't find in any of Aaron Copland's more sophisticated, or urban, works. For Copland's work is all about the heart of America. And this is America's grand national park, Yosemite.
These parks, and all of America, is a land unlike any other on earth. A land of promise, of dreams, and wilderness, where those who love the land, can truly lose themselves in its bounty and majesty, where in wonder, can bask in the warmth of friendship and friendship with the land itself.
This is what it is to have a natural world, and a national park to call your own.
As we take to the trails of Yosemite, and search for Aaron Copland, we will encounter trails where we will encounter our children and our grandchildren. And for a moment, we will forget our modern age of connectivity, as we enjoy the simple luxury of solitude and open space. We will leave our cell phones at home, our bodies and minds will become quiet. We will feel the energy of the park, and in turn, the energy of our country will find us, we will find ourselves.
Our children, and our grandchildren, will find a world of experience here, a world of adventure and exploration, a world of imagination and inspiration. This is the world of childhood, of wonder, and play, and the wonder of that play will come with time to be the joy and memories of adulthood.
Our families and the natural world, will live in harmony, a harmony that will exist for generations, perhaps even centuries, beyond us, and even beyond our wildest dreams. For the miracle of this modern world is a story of time. Time as an idea, time as a tool, time as a means of production, but also time as a country. Time as the age of man, as the experience of man.
We will experience the grand, lonely landscapes of Yosemite. We will listen to the music of our children as we experience the great soundscapes of the park. We will explore the valley floor and the higher mountains, and we will take in the breathtaking scenery of the west coast. We will lose ourselves in the wilderness and find ourselves again. We will discover why it is that Aaron Copland was so inspired, and how it is that we can inspire our own children to care for this great park and this land in turn.
In this great journey, we will take a piece of history with us, and help make our own, both as we become the memory of this place, and as we enshrine the memory of these lands into the ages to come.
We will experience a great park, and we will experience the great ages of time. And together we will experience a great country.
We will become stewards of this park, just as Copland became a steward of our nation. We will become stewards for our children, and for their children, and the children of their children. We will become stewards of the land and for future generations, as we experience the wonder of the place, the vastness of the place, the bounty of the place, and the glory of the place.
We will never stop dreaming, just as Aaron Copland will never stop writing, just as the land of Yosemite will never stop inspiring, and just as the adventure of America will never stop beckoning. And if you have children, they will never stop dreaming, because, we will never stop dreaming, and the time for dreaming is now.

To tackle this challenge, scientists used plankton as the main energy source to assess the oceanic environment and the effects of crude oil extraction activities, which may impact fish production. Results showed that higher than normal levels of hydrocarbons were observed in the plankton.
“This suggests that oil extraction and processing activities are a potential threat to planktonic life,” said Jatinder Jhala, a professor of Wildlife Biology in the University of Nevada, Reno’s School of Natural Sciences. “For example, in the case of sinking plastics in the oceanic environment, plankton forms large floating patches which act as transporters of toxins, aiding in the spread of toxins from deep ocean to the surface waters.”
Jhala added that drilling plankton, instead of other animal species, can have positive implications for the food chain because of the relationship between drilling and the whale and fish species that eat them. This supports the idea that plankton can be used as a model system to examine oceanic plastic pollution.
The team also identified that some bioplastic synthesis is capable of removing toxins that come from oil drilling activities.
The results of the study are published in the journal Plastics Pollution: Sources, Biology and Fate.

Depth is an amazing thing to me. I have an infinite curiosity to know how deep it goes.
So many secrets are hiding deep down…
I also have to know.
And I think you and I are the only ones in this team who have the curiosity to know about this.
By the way, the depth of the ocean will increase in the future, right?
And what will happen to that mysterious bacteria, which has just been discovered?
It is likely that we will never know what happens to this bacteria.
And if it does not get to the surface, what will happen to it? Will it die?
Will it go extinct?
Will it just stay in the same place and keep evolving?
To be honest, I want to know that too.
Haha. The deep sea is still mysterious.
In the future, we will probably be able to go deeper into the deep sea.
And we will definitely come across all sorts of incredible phenomena.
I really hope that someday we can get to know what’s deep down there.
My family has been diving in the past, but I haven’t had much time to do it.
I hope I can go on a dive with them some day.
The ocean is vast and ever expanding. The unknown depths and areas of it have been unexplored for as long as we have been alive. I think it’s amazing that scientists have found bacteria that can survive such depths and at extreme temperatures. This discovery could lead to a better understanding

2024-09-25 03:22:14,466 - Generated text:  a secret cave lake and the rumor was all too true. It was a wonderful sight to be there as I never expected such an elegant entrance to a cave. It was no surprise that this cave was explored so little. It was difficult to maneuver through the cave to reach the ‘Waterfall Lake’ but I was impressed with the sight of the underground lake.
After the waterfall lake, I set out to explore the deep forest surrounding the cave. I encountered a huge snake in the forest. It was a Chinese water snake, very common in Taiwan but seldom seen. This one was at least three meters in length. I put the small portion of my hand that was above ground into the snake’s mouth for a photograph. Afterwards, I grabbed onto a tree branch with my free hand and cautiously backed up so that I could get out of the snake’s reach. Astonishingly, this snake allowed me to stand a few feet away from it. I slowly walked away and had to wait at a few locations to make sure the snake stayed put. Once I was sure that the snake had no plans to attack me, I slowly and gently made my way out of the woods.
Along the way to the entrance, I stopped for some photos of a cave bat. I was astonished at how relaxed the bats were. It was my first time to see such a friendly and comfortable interaction between humans and bats. We were literally within inches from each other. One bat had its mouth opened and it was likely eating something. It was very common to see bats like this.
The Dahu wetland was a short distance from the cave. It was situated on a small tributary. In general, the wetlands and creeks in Taiwan are quite beautiful and small. There was a small pond in the wetland. Nearby was a rice paddy, popularly used in Taiwan as a stop for waterbirds.
The rice paddy was a comfortable environment for wildlife, particularly swallows. There was one species that nested on a thatched roof of the rice paddy, at the entrance. The birds were attentive parents and they hatched some very early in the year. It was quite late, as far as I know, that babies can be born in Taiwan.
The Dahu wetland was a small water source but a very good one, considering the size. The best part of all was that it was right next to the road. This allowed easy access for the occasional local birders. Afterwards, I went to my other favorite attraction in this area, the Kaohsiung Nature Center. The park was built on a dormant volcano and featured a tropical rainforest and several varieties of wildflowers.
The natural areas featured many very unique habitats and plant species. I saw what I thought were “Christmas Ferns” which were actually wild African violets that had become invasive. In the park was a small volcano. This is the first time I had seen what I presume to be the birthplace of a volcano. It was fascinating to see a spot that was so crucial to the history of a region, as Taiwan was formed by volcanoes.
I managed to get a last few great photographs as the sun began to set. The beautiful sky near the setting sun was perfect for some photos. Once the sun had set, I visited some of my usual haunts. Along the way, I was astonished at how much the local wetlands were abandoned at this time of year. All the rice paddies that normally held birds had completely dried up. It was the end of bird season.
There is no question that the wildlife situation was a bit worse in Taiwan than my home country, USA. The migration was in progress. There was still a lot of wildlife to see, however. A few Common Moorhens were on the final day of their journey. They had begun their migration a few days before and were now in their final destination.
One of my favorite species of birds in Taiwan was the Common Moorhens. I had some of my best birding experiences in Taiwan during the Common Moorhens’ migration. It is a time of plenty for these species. There are many temporary ponds along the migration route that provide a rich food source for the Moorhens. These large ponds are formed by the numerous agricultural water channels. I had photographed these birds many times in their breeding season. They were always a pleasure to photograph.
Once I was back at home, I decided to put up some posts of wildlife in Taiwan for you all. I hope that you enjoy the photos that I managed to get of wildlife in Taiwan. The country will always have a special place in my

In the far distant future, the world's rising sea levels have caused one third of the world's population to flee the coastal cities to live on colossal floating island nations. Now, armed conflicts between rival nations have erupted over limited resources, and a war is about to break out.

He wanders the land on his iron horse with his only companion, the mentally unstable wind spirit named Kokoa, who is often trapped in his wrist. Years ago, he had the unique ability to see the Black Star Event, which happens once every 100 years, when a star disappears from the sky and light falls to earth in the form of meteoric sand.
To save her mother's life, Nayuta has been taken to the Dead Star, a meteorite that has been forced to a standstill over the island city of Old Home. There she is subjected to the torture of the Espers: artifacts of the Star God that can channel the Black Star Event. But there is hope...
One day, two Espers join forces with Nayuta to change her fate. Only time will tell if this unthinkable plan will succeed.
There is a town in the moon surrounded by seven walls, each of which stands 12,000 feet tall. The people who live there are known as "Moon People." Ren, a young boy who lives on the outskirts of this town, has been found and brought to the Moon People. He possesses a special power: He is able to jump into the skies and even travel to other worlds, which leads to the questions of why the Moon People brought him there and what they want with him.

One of the musicians, a girl named Ehomaki, finds Hoichi, a wounded wandering samurai and cures him. Hoichi was believed to be undead but Ehomaki takes a liking to him and hides him in her home with the musicians. The band plays for him every night to appease his haunting spirits. Hoichi's haunting spirits soon befriended the musicians and they too begin playing music for him to pacify his memories and appease his restless spirits.
The samurai love peace and music but cannot play because they cannot hear. When they play for Hoichi, it brings them comfort and happiness in a loving environment. As the music plays, Hoichi moves towards the lute and

Maher to his parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Maher, who lived at 2571 Scranton Ave. The soldier wrote that he had to spend Christmas Day, his birthday and New Years’ Eve in the trenches. The letter concluded, “Well, folks, I am closing for tonight. I guess I will be on the go day and night for the next 10 days, as I will be with the guns. Hoping this finds you all in the best of health. A week from today will make two months since I left, and now I don’t know when I will get home.

Jon Favreau Takes 6 Minutes to Cook Bacon in Rare Footage From ‘Chef’

How Jon Favreau decided to make Chef a 100% live movie
Chef had to be shot practically in order to deliver the on-screen experience the director and crew intended. But that didn’t mean they had to be boring.

I think The Lion King is one of the most incredible movies ever made. I think it’s one of the greatest musicals ever made.

Jon Favreau on Bringing Back Indie Film Studio ‘Swingers’
“I was very young, but I was very dedicated,” Favreau recalled in a recent Variety interview. “I just did it full-time, seven days a week. I was a one-man band. The creative responsibilities were endless. So I’d wake up, I’d figure out the lighting. I’d be my own set decorator. I’d take the box of masking tape and just tape out where the wall is. Then I’d staple it. Then I’d go put it up. I’d do the sound, too. I’d have three jobs.”

Jon Favreau and Amy Sedaris (actors, writers) join Danny Gallagher to discuss their roles in the film “Ralph Breaks the Internet.” They discuss how they became involved with the project, the character dynamics of Ralph and Vanellope, and their characters’ friendship.
I really loved the opening to “Chef,” in which you cooked on set and cast an actor who could cook (John Leguizamo) to play one of the lead roles. How did you come up with that idea, and did it alter the rest of the shoot at all?
Well, the truth is, that idea came from my son, Max. He was about 7 at the time. The idea was, “What if we took a camera inside the kitchen and showed him cooking? And the food was just really good.”
We put it in front of the director, Adam Sandler, and the producers, and they were like, “OK, we’ll give it a shot.” So, we decided that we would do the pilot in my kitchen and use real-life recipes that I loved. I would write them, and they would cook them. I had an assistant who would write a big “NO” on the recipe that I didn’t like.
The entire season was like this: I would show up and have breakfast at the same table, and they would say, “No, no, we’re not eating that today.” Then we’d go into the kitchen, and

But who is behind the wars of change?
Akiva was born in a galaxy torn asunder by civil war. He could do nothing to avert the doom that was about to sweep over his home. Then he was chosen for a new task, in the distant future. Now, he wakes up in a strange place, to a strange planet, to a new destiny he never wanted.
But who is this new civilization?
Who is following the Guardians?
And who is against them?
One thing is clear: either Akiva will rise to the task that the Guilds have set him, or all the hope of the universe will die with him.
“It’s clear that you care about the Guardian on a personal level. He’s a man who’s been through a lot in his life, and I’d like to hear all about it. Care to share?”
“My pleasure, sir.” I stared into his deep-set eyes for a few moments, then fell into a brief recap. I included the battle of Shadai and the twin infernos, how the Valor-less guild had fallen to the fanatics, the death of my mother at the hands of the Shandel-men, the loss of my ship, the battle on the command deck, how we came to be on this ship. I left out my time on the other side, and I did not mention the mention of the Guardians’ continued existence as an even remotely coherent or viable force.
“Hope,” The Guardian replied, when I had finished. I hadn’t expected him to have much to say, but his word seemed strangely ill-fitting. In his voice, I heard something I had never heard before.
“Is it?” I asked.
“It can be,” He said. “It will be. But only if those who follow the way of peace and harmony are willing to stand up to the ones who preach war and destruction.”
“To show those who seek to divide that we are willing to stand together, to fight for what we believe in. You are different, Akiva. We have little choice but to trust you.”
“What will you do with me, when we reach our destination?”
“You’ll be inducted into the Guardian’s Service. From that day forth, you will be a Guard-ian. My service.” He seemed to take it for granted that I would join him, but it didn’t take away the eagerness I felt for the whole thing.
I would finally be a Guardian.
“Do you have any questions, Akiva?”
I hesitated, and looked to the portal again. There was no reason to hide anything from the Guardian, but neither did I have to open myself to him completely. “My last question is this: why me?”
The Guardian smiled. “You understand what is at stake in this battle of civilizations. The Guardians are willing to fight, but it is those on our side who must prove they are willing to die. You came to me from the other side, but that makes you a natural choice to send back to them, and to learn what they know, so that we may better face them.”
“You could choose one of the other four who’ve survived. Even Mita.”
“Yes, I could, but I’ve made my choice.” He let the subject drop.
“What would you know, if not for the other Guardians?” I asked.
“The other Guilds know the whereabouts of the portal. The Guardians are the only ones who know the location of this portal. It’s a gateway to another galaxy.
“And you don’t know its location.”
“I’m willing to bet you do.”
“It’s safe to say that we do.”
“And I’m willing to bet that, even if you did, you’re not going to tell me.”
“It’s quite safe to say that I’m not going to tell you.”
I rubbed my neck, thinking. He had given me very little to go on, and I’d had to do a lot of the guessing on my own. “You know I can’t go on with this whole thing with Mita’s knowledge. If I did, I’d have to leave her here on this ship. No one can know where the portal is, or else it might be used against us. This is a one-way trip.”
“Of course

“Do you know how many times I’ve failed?” asks Amy Adams’ character on her tear-stained face in “Vice,” the biopic about vice-president Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne. And the answer is a lot, with one of the film’s critical darlings crashing and burning again in a perfunctory horror movie directed by Adam McKay.
Although it has a few creepy ideas, “Velvet Buzzsaw” is neither creepy nor interesting, squandering another chance for McKay to reinvigorate a tired genre. If, like me, you hated the ham-fisted smugness of “The Big Short” and the nonsensical “Anchorman 2,” you won’t be disappointed, though, because McKay’s brand of smugness is like a slowing-down, dial-back version. Instead of choosing someone like Andy Serkis to put the audience through the wringer like he did with Christian Bale, he’s chosen a cast of movie stars who are capable of carrying a movie on their own. As a result, “Velvet Buzzsaw” is unable to establish itself as a particularly coherent character study, let alone a scary one. I almost felt sorry for its victim, played by Rory Cochrane, a mediocre actor by the director’s standards who is now undoubtedly consigned to direct-to-video movies in an infinite loop, all because he had the audacity to drop a video.
So is “Velvet

Jirí Barta was born on 14 September 1948 in Prague. He graduated from the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (DAMU) with his 1972 diploma film, THE SEDUCTION (21 MINUTES, 1971), which won numerous awards at international festivals. In the 1980s, he became director of the FAMU Film School, and in 2000 was made Chairman of the film school. Since 1990 he has served as the Head of the Documentary Film department at FAMU. He is well known for his live-action works and authored the scripts for his films. He has been awarded several times at major international festivals, including the Special Jury Prize at Venice for A KELLER FAMILY PORTRAIT (55 MINUTES, 1983). In 1998 his film VERDENSTEIN won the Silver Palm at Cannes.
DUSAN HAUBR is a writer and director who graduated from Prague Film Academy. He began his career in the 1970s at the state studio Barrandov where he cooperated on several productions as a scriptwriter and co-director. Since 1990, he has worked as an independent artist and is one of the most respected directors of documentary films in the Czech Republic. His films have been screened at many international film festivals and have won several awards.
Two years ago, there was a film competition in LA called 'In the Eyes of the Dragon'. The short film competition was done in the style of wuxia movies. All entries were supposed to have dragons in them. There were some pretty creative, interesting, and ambitious entries. Then we saw one. The "director" was so desperate to win that he did a couple of things.
1) He used a pair of air brushes, and painted over one of the scenes. It didn't look bad. But the paint kept oozing out and running in some places. 2) He stole a lot of footage and edited it to make it look like the entire movie was done in one day. The camera was a flip style camera, and a very small camera. 3) He did not want to admit that the camera that he used, was from a different time period. 4) He shot out of order, and couldn't match up his own footage. It's a shame that some movies are so ambitious, that they are willing to cheat to get it. That's just lazy.
This is a true story. Not only that, but the narrator is the brother of the inventor of the time machine, his son, and his mother.
The film begins with a look at his initial inspiration and the invention. The father goes on to do more experiments, which ultimately do not work out. But, he does get a few things right, and does finally invent the machine.
But there are more problems. The machine can not be tested, as the father does not have enough money to do it, and the clock work breaks. The father is now over-extended, and can not finish his inventions. So, the mother and son step in. They make the clock and help the father finish the machine.
It is a bit slow at the beginning, but once you get into it, it gets pretty good. The story is very interesting. I recommend this movie. It is really worth the time to watch it.
I think the movie is the best one I've seen in a long time. The movie is not perfect, but it is good. The acting is good, the story is good, and the script is good. I would like to see a sequel of this movie. I really hope that this movie will become a cult classic. It is not perfect, but it is a good movie.
I really liked this movie. I like the main character

The past is lost to time. I do not know the truth, but I hope to return to that sweet place soon.
In that wonderful time, when life was so sweet and life's horrors so distant, laughter and pain alike were delightful as the sorrowful rainbows that never ended.
Yet for those days and nights to be remembered, I have called upon the spirits of the townspeople long since departed from this world. One day, they will return.
Together, we will be able to rebuild, and recreate that beautiful place and perfect time. Until then, we will remain trapped in this magical world, awaiting our time to shine once more.
You are called upon to restore the town to its former glory. The inhabitants are already there, awaiting your magical touch and your assistance.
Restore the town to its former glory!
Collect the missing ingredients for the magic potion.
Create the magic potion with the townspeople's help.
Destroy the enchantments that are blocking access to the town.
Reunite the townspeople. Bring your childhood memories to life once more.

A quarter century after the Great War, the ever-stronger Targaryen army, which surrounds the kingdom, no longer respects the borders of Westeros. They are only stopped by the arrival of a giant meteorite that crashes into the sea.
In this new world, the former king’s sister has created a new order that enslaves everyone. But there is one who wants to set the people free. Azelia Mandrake, a former witch, who later became a sorcerer and is able to summon and control the Legion of the Undead, has managed to survive. Now the war against the Targaryen dynasty begins. But in the fight, Azelia will find her biggest enemy … and the fate of Westeros itself.
This is a French translation of "Warlords and Wizards", in 560 pages with 44 illustrations by Mathieu Laboureyre and many diagrams.
Several Westeros
A 560-page volume that brings together the three best-selling titles by the series author:
“The Mystery of Dragonstone” and “The Black Wolf of the Fog”.
Four new novels from Westeros and Essos:
“From the age of the witches”, “The plague” and “Warlords and Wizards” have just been released. All the action takes place two centuries after the end of the series “A Song of Ice and Fire”.
In a world that combines magic and technology, the classic battle between good and evil, civilization and the primitive world takes place.
Citizens are divided into 5 groups: Imperialists, Ramblers, Slaveholders, the Guardian Church, the Techs, the Yellow Kings, as well as a powerful secret society, the Order of Darkness, which knows no borders.
The story is about the fight for the leadership of the world, when one of the last scions of the Targaryen dynasty, King Robert of the Seven Kingdoms, inherits the throne.
Here we can read the adventures of Azelia Mandrake, a powerful sorceress with unusual abilities. Her main task will be to unite the rebels, help the enslaved masses, and break the reign of terror of the evil Queen Mariana.
New series of books “Game of Thrones” by George R.R. Martin “Warlords and wizards” features:
-The battle of the Targaryen dynasty with the Lannisters;
-A huge number of wars and battles between the great houses;
-Magic, knights, and sorcery.
This series of books will appeal to readers with an interest in science fiction and fantasy literature.
I am only at the beginning but the read is very interesting and my family are always a topic of discussion about the book.
The biggest I've ever read. And probably never again. However, it was worth it. It's really cool that they started to print fantasy with scientific illustrations. In my opinion, fantasy literature is kind of science fiction. It's just more mysterious and magic. It would be cool if the books of this series could be illustrated. I understand that this series has very little science fiction and fantasy, but even a little bit. It would be good if the author of the series would turn to the painter as a hobby. This would not only attract more attention to the series but also increase interest.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,467 - Generated text:  modern day happiness, shared by the staff at Scribble Creative.
A perfect afternoon in the country can only be enhanced by a hot bowl of soup, with a loaf of bread dipped into it. Nothing beats it.
But it doesn’t have to be hot, which is why I love vegetable soup. The basic recipe will always produce the best results. But then I get to do what I love best – play!
1 head of bok choy cut into bite size pieces.
a 30cm x 12cm piece of bacon.
Throw all ingredients (except the bacon) into a pot, and bring to boil for 5 minutes. Reduce to low and cook for a further 30 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper to season.
Meanwhile dice up the bacon, and cook in a large fry pan until crispy. Add to the soup just before serving, and enjoy!
It couldn’t be easier, or more delicious. But let’s face it, we can’t all wake up and head to the country every day of the week. It’s not realistic!
Well here’s a little secret. Fill a bowl of water with vegetables, you can use the ones you are using in the soup. Just fill the bowl with about 2.5 cm of water. Drop the finished bok choy into the bowl, and cover the top with cling wrap.
You’ll notice that the water will turn dark and this is because the vegetables are releasing their vitamins. This is a quick way to add colour to your vegetables before eating.
Let’s be honest. Most of us think the height of cool is being able to pick up a veggie and not having it be cold. But this is not the case. Most of our vegetables don’t have a skin that protects them like an apple. They actually need to be stored in a cool environment to keep them crunchy. This is true of avocado, broccoli, spinach and all our salad greens, including lettuce, rocket, parsley, coriander, basil and cucumber.
When shopping for these vegetables in the fridge aisle, it is better to buy a bag that is tightly packed and is cold, rather than loose, and therefore warmer.
This is because the cold packed bag of vegetables contains less air and therefore will take longer to warm. So next time you go to the veggie isle, you’ll be able to buy a bag of veggies rather than a plastic tub with air trapped in it.
Place a loaf of bread on a bread board, slice and drizzle with a generous amount of olive oil. Add salt, pepper and sprinkle with paprika. Pop in the oven for 20 minutes. While the bread is in the oven, add the soup to a large soup pot and bring it to the boil. Check the salt and pepper levels and serve. This is the perfect breakfast recipe.
Remember that warmth and comfort are not an actual outcome. These are feelings that come from the contentment of our stomachs. When we are satisfied, we feel better. I hope this vegetable soup recipe will make you feel warm and comforted on a cold day. I wish you all the best for 2016 and hope that you start every day with this delicious soup recipe. Happy New Year!
The two year old waited in anticipation, while her mum rushed around doing last minute shopping, tidying the house and preparing for the Easter long weekend. Finally she was allowed to pick out what she wanted to wear to school and church. With all the excitement of colourful dresses and an outfit for church and a dress for preschool, her mum was anxious.
The next morning when she arrived at school to collect her child, the clothes on the line suddenly stopped spinning and everything else went blank. What had she done? How could she have allowed her child to wear something so unacceptable?
Her two year old was covered in red dye from head to toe. The dress had flown off and splashed red all over. Her mum, mortified, tried to quickly go to her room to remove the child. But no! The child was wearing the same dress to church and she couldn’t bear the shame.
As her mum approached the car, she removed the child, wiped her off as best she could and arrived in church. There was hardly a word to be heard throughout the service, not just because she was late

2024-09-25 03:22:14,467 - Generated text:  a life of betrayal, regret, and immeasurable love. Into the lives of two women from different worlds steps a third whose time and work is spent cultivating life in this metaphorical garden. A modern version of THE YELLOW WALLPAPER, THE TROUBLE WITH TREEHOUSES shows us how human nature and our choices never go out of style.
Annabel Duvall is a recent college graduate who works in the rare book room of the university library. Her inability to sleep is now a part of who she is and has affected every aspect of her life. A scholarship student, she is trying to finish her degree in economics in order to prove herself and find a secure future. When her roommate brings home a beaten-up copy of The Yellow Wallpaper for her, Annabel becomes obsessed with the short story and decides to find out if there is any more to the book. She has always believed in the value of story, the magic of imagination, and the necessity of art. That is how she is able to withstand the misguided encouragement of her parents and the well-meaning advice of a smitten coworker. In her search for answers, she finds the letter written to John by his sister-in-law and begins to understand her, her husband, and herself better.
Annabel’s life is forever changed when she is given an unexpected opportunity. She has been asked to stay on and work as the rare books librarian for the summer. However, when a young man from the biology department shows interest in her, she is less than interested in him. Before she can reject him, he goes away for the summer and there is an unexpected and awkward second encounter between them. Annabel’s summer is quiet until she is asked by an old friend of the family to catalog a collection of letters, starting with this one to John. That is when she meets the woman who, at one time, was her parents’ maid and whose name is Leontyne. The years and hardships of the two women’s lives have given them many things in common and they bond over the weeks of cataloguing.
The Trouble With Treehouses is an inspirational novel about the importance of story and imagination. The story of one woman’s childhood and love for literature is touching. The passion and enthusiasm of the author for her craft is evident in her writing and the research she does in order to write the novel. The secondary characters in this story are mostly those who have loved Annabel or still love her and want to see her succeed. Leontyne is the only character who is always there to help her. Leontyne is from another generation, but there is something very maternal about her. There are no antagonists in this book, only good people with good intentions. I think that the story has universal appeal and could be enjoyed by anyone who loves reading.
Copies of The Trouble With Treehouses are available through Random House.

Glad to see a novel about a young woman who loves reading and library work. I always enjoy meeting someone I can identify with. Will look for this book. I also admire the author’s blog at MaineCrimeWriter.com. Congratulations to Camille DeAngelis on her novel.
Thanks so much for this post, Charlotte!
Loved the comments about how good the writing is in this book. Also, the theme of the importance of reading is strong. But what I most liked is that the story was so compelling–that I never wanted it to end.
My grandmother read this novel and recommended it to me. I’m going to have to pick it up soon. Sounds wonderful!
What a lovely review, Charlotte. And I just want to say I’m very happy to see you here, Ann.
Thank you so much for reading and commenting on my review of THE TROUBLE WITH TREEHOUSES, RHYS! Your kind words about the book and me have made my day!
This sounds like a wonderful book for booklovers!
Must read. Sounds great! Glad you liked it Charlotte!

2024-09-25 03:22:14,468 - Generated text:  a new season, and for some plants, it can also mean the beginning of a new lifespan.
For many types of plants, “buds” and “blossoms” are equivalent terms, but as the season progresses, they change forms and sometimes even become new plants.
Let’s look at the different stages of plant growth and development and learn about each one.
Some plants don’t produce seeds or seed pods, and those that do can’t produce seeds without a nearby parent plant, so many perennials and annuals must be grown from seeds.
Many common flowers, such as marigolds, lilies, daisies, and daffodils, reproduce via seed pods. These pods develop into bulbs in many species, and they can be used as garden seedlings.
Bulbs can produce both blossoms and buds, but the buds will eventually become flowers.
Many plants form buds at the base of their branches. They will grow into blossoms or new leaves, depending on the season.
Most of these buds will become flowers, and they can become quite large, although some will never flower and will remain green and hard.
The two ends of the flower bud are called petals, while the rest of the flower is called the sepals.
A bud is a group of cells that will develop into a new plant or plant part.
As the cells divide, they form two new plants that will be joined by a stem that grows out of the bud.
The stem will form a new stem cell and a root, while the cells that were already in the stem will form the buds.
There are two main stages in a plant’s life cycle, when the flowers are forming, and after the flowers have been produced.
When the flower is forming, it is called the flowerbud.
After the flower is formed, it is called the bud stage.
The stage after the flowers are formed is called buddy, or the flower stage.
Bud stage is the stage where flowers are formed.
This stage is when a flower is just beginning to flower.
It is usually the most fertile and least-wild stage, but can also be very fruitful, depending on what kind of plants you grow.
When you’re growing your plants, you may need to fertilize them.
Some fertilizer companies add nutrients to the fertilizer and they may add more to the mixture as the plant grows.
In the wild, fertilizers are usually added to the leaves of the flower.
Some fertilizers also have a fungicide in them, which prevents the fungi from forming.
A fungicide is an organic substance that prevents fungi from growing.
You can also fertilize your flowers by applying fertilizer directly to the flowers, and then fertilizing the soil around the flower, or you can spray them with fertilizer.
If you don’t have a fertilizing area nearby, you can still fertilize flowers with a fertilizer, which contains the same ingredients as fertilizer.
Some of the plants that have been most successful in growing from seed pods include rose and lavender, lily, dandelion, camellia, and lily of the valley.
A seed pod will produce a new bud and the seeds that it contains, so seed pods can be used as plants for a variety of uses.
You can also grow seed pods in your own garden, if you have access to a garden center.
In addition to growing seedpods, you could also grow bulbs and bulbs that are native to your region, which you could then grow in a pot or a garden area.
Many plants grow from seed in the soil, but you can also grow them from the ground.
In many regions, you have to use an underground greenhouse, but you could also start your own.
The greenhouse is a glass-covered area that can be used for seed production, growing, and drying.
It can be used for up to 10 plants at a time, and can also be used indoors.
It can be made from plastic or a combination of the two, and you can also buy it from a retail store.
The plants that grow from these greenhouses are called “seedlings.”
Some people prefer to grow plants indoors, but you may also prefer to use a greenhouse for growing from seeds.
Some common types of seedlings include: a) Seeds of rose and lavender, the species that make up the rose plant.
b) Seeds from lavender, the one you would use for lavender.
c) Seed of camellia,

2024-09-25 03:22:14,468 - Prompt 116: A misdelivered package contains a gadget from the future, which
2024-09-25 03:22:14,468 - Generated text:  inspires the company’s newest innovation: a piezoelectric/acoustic transducer (AKA, piezo speaker) that delivers 50% greater sound volume.
Stencil cut from Anodized Aluminum using MetalWorks 3D.
Within the first year of the All Electronics Corporation (ACE) mailroom’s opening, Marvin Sandberg, one of the company’s engineers, received an unsolicited package containing a device to replace the factory’s sound speakers. Unknown to Sandberg, the gadget contained the seeds of a future collaboration with a professor from MIT.
“You see, there’s a good reason why we get the mail for the company,” said Walt Kelley, inventor of the piezo transducer and manager of All Electronics Corporation mailroom. “Every day we receive boxes from various parts of the world. Anything from valves, tape recorders, and radios to tubes, meters and what not. You name it, we get it. And that’s how we found the machine.
The mailer was addressed to an engineer named Marvin Sandberg. Its contents were an envelope full of dried up seeds, and an attached letter.
“There’s probably some interesting science in what I’m about to send you. Study these little seeds if you’re interested in the advancement of sound reproduction. If you’re not interested in that, don’t bother.”
Even though he’d never worked with acoustic transducers before, Sandberg was fascinated by the seeds. He took his package to MIT to see if he could get any help with the seeds.
“The seeds were a bit unusual,” Sandberg said. “The first transducer I made from them worked, but wasn’t great. But I’m stubborn. I worked on them for a year until I finally produced a high quality prototype. It was a challenge, but I succeeded. We’re very grateful to that Mr. Dickenson for sending us that package.
The transducer of the speaker prototypes.
“Our next step is to scale the piezo transducer, and make it more affordable for use in mass produced sound equipment,” Sandberg continued. “I think that we could sell these transducers to AM Radio companies, so that they could retrofit their receivers. With the new technology, a regular household sized speaker could produce the same volume as a big truck.”
Although the piezo transducer is ready to be scaled, one final issue remains to be solved: a piezo speaker mount. Since the prototypes lack a firm mounting mechanism, the transducer can only vibrate in a single direction. The company’s engineers have recently developed a mount that will allow the transducer to vibrate in two dimensions.
With this new mounting mechanism in place, the new piezo speakers will have greater flexibility for volume and frequency adjustment.
With this new mounting mechanism in place, the new piezo speakers will have greater flexibility for volume and frequency adjustment. The company hopes to begin mass production of the piezo speakers in early next year, so that local residents can enjoy better sound quality at home.
“I think the timing is right for these transducers,” Sandberg said. “We’ve managed to bring down the cost, and I think the new mounting mechanism will improve volume and frequency stability as well. If you’re interested in getting your hands on a piezo speaker, I suggest you contact the local AM radio company, and see if they can retrofit your truck.
In celebration of this new development, ACE has recently invested in state-of-the-art printing capabilities, so that they can quickly provide large quantities of their products to consumers.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,469 - Prompt 122: A breakthrough in renewable energy presents solutions to long-standing problems of
2024-09-25 03:22:14,469 - Generated text:  energy storage
A team of researchers from the University of British Columbia has discovered a new method for energy storage. By reducing a hydrocarbon mixture to a form of lithium hydrocarbonate, the researchers are able to harness hydrogen more efficiently to generate electricity and solve two energy-related problems: how to store hydrogen on a large scale and how to use hydrogen for electricity generation with greater efficiency.
The discovery, reported in the Nature journal, could help drive the adoption of hydrogen fuel as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels in industry, transportation and everyday life.
Hydrogen-fuelled cars, buses and planes are often labelled 'zero-emission' vehicles because the only waste product of burning hydrogen is water. But as most of the hydrogen currently used by industry is produced using fossil fuels (and, more recently, using renewable sources such as wind and solar power) this so-called zero-emission fuel isn't quite green enough to be a truly clean energy alternative.
For hydrogen to live up to its green promise, the researchers say it will need to be produced from water, using renewable energy such as solar or wind power. Hydrogen, which has the highest possible energy-to-weight ratio among all chemicals, is light and highly flammable. It is the most abundant chemical on earth and is found in large quantities in fossil fuels. But burning fossil hydrogen produces CO2, the leading greenhouse gas, and other pollutants. So how to produce it cleanly and cheaply without producing carbon dioxide has been one of the biggest challenges in renewable energy research.
Today, some of the biggest challenges remain in both technological and practical terms, but the UBC researchers believe they have solved both problems in one fell swoop with their method.
"In the past, you could store hydrogen, but it was difficult to manage and very inefficient at converting hydrogen back into electricity because of the way that the hydrogen atoms bind to the metal," says lead author of the study, Catalin Moldoveanu, a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemistry at UBC. "Now, we are able to store hydrogen in a highly active state, which is great for electricity generation. Plus, we can recover more than 99 per cent of the hydrogen after storage, which is a better way to store hydrogen, compared to other methods that have been attempted."
To achieve this feat, the researchers used a process known as reforming, in which a carbon-containing molecule (methane or ethane, for example) is heated and passed over a catalyst made from nickel and palladium. This process produces hydrogen, and in the new system the hydrogen is trapped in the form of a hydrocarbon salt (lithium-hydrocarbonate). A subsequent electrolysis process releases hydrogen atoms from the hydrocarbon, which react with oxygen to produce electricity.
In this way, energy can be stored in the form of the lithium hydrocarbonate, which can be used as a fuel to generate electricity in a hydrogen fuel cell. By recovering the lithium hydrocarbonate for use as fuel in a future generation, hydrogen can be stored with up to 99 per cent efficiency. If hydrogen cannot be used in time, it can be turned back into a hydrocarbon, which can be stored, or returned to water.
"By keeping the water cycle intact, and by using the water molecules as a highly efficient way to store hydrogen, we are actually able to increase the efficiency of hydrogen for energy generation," says Moldoveanu. "This is a significant improvement over existing storage systems that use more complex and expensive systems."
The invention, known as the Lithium Storage Ionization system, opens up new opportunities for many hydrogen-based technologies, including long-distance transportation, which currently relies on gasoline and other fossil fuels.
"What's exciting is that we don't need to rebuild the entire transportation infrastructure in order to take advantage of this technology," says Moldoveanu. "We can just introduce the storage ionization to existing cars, buses and planes to allow them to run on hydrogen."
The Lithium Storage Ionization system has the potential to replace most hydrogen generation and storage technologies currently used, the researchers say. In addition, the process can be run using just solar or wind power, producing fuel that is clean and renewable.
Moldoveanu, who completed the study under the supervision of Professor Ted Sargent, says the technology has several advantages over existing

" A stunning celebration of the sunny friendship that has inspired artist Julia Frances Harrison for years. . .A truly wonderful picture book." —Kirkus
"This is a truly stunning book. The illustrations capture the essence of the Julia and her friends and it is a wonderful tribute to the Julia I know." —Julia Harrison
Jane Heitman Healy grew up with a love of painting and drawing. She received her MFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and is the illustrator of the picture books Hark, A Shark!; All Fish Fear Me; A Peep Inside the Art Museum; Big Plans; and No, Max! She lives in Chicago with her husband and daughter.
Julia Frances Harrison grew up with a love of painting and drawing. She graduated from Ball State University with a degree in illustration. Her work can be found in private collections and galleries, and in a number of children's books including Now and then: A Book of Years and Dreaming of You. She lives in New York City with her husband, a portrait artist.
In their newest picture book, Healy and Harrison paint a warm, vibrant tribute to friendship and collaboration. A seafoam palette and spirited gestures render the self-taught Harrison's fellow artists with an infectious energy: “Together they splash and scrub and splatter until their hands are dirty and their sketchbooks are empty.” All that activity, however, proves inspirational for each woman as she returns to her studio and puts her brush to canvas, turning her vision into reality. Readers are treated to glimpses of the finished paintings, each brimming with just as much character and passion as the paintings-in-progress. From their individual personalities to their shared artistic impulses, these spirited women will be an endearing addition to any young reader’s social circle. Ages 2–5. (Apr.)
Four friends—Julia, Mary, Emily, and Lydia—gather to sketch. By the time they leave the beach, the four ladies are covered in paint from their artwork, but they feel joyfully inspired to create. With a simple rhyming verse, Healy uses colorful and expressive paintbrush strokes to illustrate these four artists. Readers are given a sneak peek into Julia’s artwork on the final page of the book. This is a truly stunning book. The illustrations capture the essence of the Julia and her friends and it is a wonderful tribute to the Julia I know.
Jane Heitman Healy’s dazzling collage illustrations and the charm of this tribute to women who create with paint make this book as enjoyable for children as it is for adults.

The male lead is about as carefree as a peanut can get, but will remain so until something changes in his life.
Have a listen as the books are read aloud from their website.
With a snarky attitude and twisted plot, it's like reading the guide to dementia.
Pet Shop Boys are on the shop shelf this week, who will buy?
A humorous and heartfelt story about what it means to be a friend.
Cleverness and violence, in a story that could have been told more than once.
A humorous and human show, that gets a lot done.
The characters aren't a complex or creative as they could have been, but the performances are strong enough to make it enjoyable.
Tell someone this is a spy drama and you'll likely raise an eyebrow, but it's more like the township soap opera.
A strange, and very small, story about family, parenting and love.
The first episode is a look at what may come, but the others are pieces of a series. They may not be entirely clear, but are surprisingly thoughtful.
It's like listening to a play, but with a much more visual plot. The scenery and atmosphere seem secondary to the style of the performance.
Just a really odd choice to adapt into a TV show. It's quiet, and we learn nothing.
Funny, touching and fantastically designed, this is a great story for both kids and adults.
It's an animated show, and is good in its own way, but it would have worked better as a live action show.
This is a bunch of guys being bros, doing a bunch of male stuff. There isn't much to say about it, except for what you already know.
It's a short story that fits the same formula as a lot of TV shows, but the characters and tone are both realistic and relateable.
What a show! A lot of crazy things happen, but it's more than that, the story is woven throughout and fits nicely, rather than coming off as nonsense.
Like most dream sequences it's difficult to tell what is real and what isn't. This is clearly just a show of itself.
Some great jokes to add to a better than average story. The delivery is mostly by one guy, so it gets a little boring, but not too much.
This is a normal cop show with some modern twists, but it's clearly a cheap TV show, so it's not great.
This is a sequel to a sequel to a book that was meant to be a sequel to a TV show, so the plot is very convoluted.
The video effects are great, but the story is just blah, and this episode is all that you'll see.
Another brilliant show about grief and grieving. While most American shows focus on the poor decisions the main character makes, this show is about the dad making the best decisions he can.
It's basically just an American TV show with an Asian cast.
If you liked Spirited Away you'll probably like this, if you haven't seen that movie, it's one of the best.
An interesting idea is wasted by poorly written characters and a subpar script.
This is the super-high-budget version of The Wire, so there are a lot of deep and real ideas about the community, police, society and so on.
This show has a lot to say about racism, how governments work, and what to do with the youth.
So many shots of nature and scenery, and you can feel the allure of living in that kind of beauty.
It's almost a movie, but it's also a TV show, so it's a little less dramatic than most TV shows and more formal.
This series is very enjoyable, but there is a bit too much 'no-one is listening to me', and a lack of musical progression in the series.
No time to talk about animation, it's all about the story, which is good.
This show is good, but it's not great. It's trying to be great, but it's a little pretentious and overly-confident.
There is some very strong visual art and staging, but the voices aren't done very well, and the story is rather simple.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,469 - Generated text:  some bullying from a fellow student.
Here are my thoughts and commentary.
1. For a story about a “very small” dragon there are a lot of shots where he’s shown dwarfed by the surroundings.
2. The dragon’s father has a small flashback about his days as a soldier where he rode atop a giant sea serpent. While this is probably just my imagination, I wonder if that’s a reference to the idea of riding a whale in the culture.
3. I appreciate that this isn’t a movie about violence. All the conflict is couched in a relatively lighthearted manner and there’s no real violence.
4. This doesn’t seem like the sort of movie that I’m used to from China. This one is very American and at one point the main character even refers to his “American friend”.
5. It’s pretty obvious from early on that the bully isn’t actually evil. He just wants to feel accepted.
6. The bully is creepy because he spends his free time wandering through the corridors of the school. This is interesting because it’s possible he’s not doing anything wrong. On the one hand, he has the student ID to do it. On the other, the doors are supposed to remain locked and only the staff has the key. The only thing I don’t get is how this behavior could have gone undetected for so long.
7. It’s also obvious that the main character is the only one who’s actually upset by the bully’s behavior. Everyone else is too afraid to speak up and the bully’s father has no idea what’s going on.
8. The big climax is a little anti-climatic and I’m honestly not sure why it was necessary. This is a pretty harmless movie and I can’t imagine anyone is harmed by not having this part.
9. It’s really neat to see Asian students learning a song that has “New York” in it.
10. I’m not sure the creator had any budget to shoot a big musical number, so there’s some voiceover that’s pretty bad. If there’s one thing I can say, this movie does a lot with a small budget. The sets are small, but they look good.
11. After his big climax, the big bully is given a free pass to study and move forward. I wonder if this is a harsh reality for people who have no friends.
12. At the end, there’s a neat callback to the opening scene where a fairy almost steps on a spider and the spider leaps off. The dragon must have a good sense of humor since he asks if the spider would like to be made into pizza.
13. One more thing that I’m pretty sure is a reference to the Dungeons and Dragons game. The dragon’s friend is a girl with horns and a red cloak. They both live in a tower that is a reference to the Starcrest tower that was the subject of several modules.

Companies want to know us better so they can market their products and services more effectively. Governments want to know us better so they can understand and provide for our needs. In Hrafnkat's world, we have all agreed to give up some of our privacy in order to keep moving forward. By doing so, we have given up many of the illusions of privacy we once held dear. And the moment that we do, we have inadvertently created a society in which a potential catastrophe is always lurking: a society in which we are no longer trusted. Authored by a group of writers that include Elizabeth Baines, James Bates, Brian Evenson, and Alethea Black, 101 Reykjavik introduces a world that will be all too familiar to readers once we have begun to accept a different version of privacy. This collection examines an online future where every act is monitored and where anonymity is only an illusion, not a reality. Through a collection of original stories, 101 Reykjavik introduces a compelling vision of the not-so-distant future, where the digital footprints that we leave behind for everyone to see have changed the way we see ourselves and others. This collection will challenge readers to explore the various ways that we are shaped and molded by technology. Once upon a time, we used to see ourselves as something greater than the sum of our data; now, we are defined by our data, and we have let our data define us. In the pages of 101 Reykjavik, we see ourselves and our world. Through the lens of these writers, we see the humanity in a technologically advanced society that has given up the one thing that makes us all uniquely human: our privacy. All royalties from the sales of 101 Reykjavik will be donated to Reykjavik's Keldur Foundation. The Keldur Foundation is dedicated to promoting independent literature through a system of grants. Writers are given the support they need to promote and distribute their books - the idea being that increased awareness of these works leads to an increase in the quantity and quality of work that is published.
Hrafnkat Orn Gunnlaugsson was born in Iceland and studied in the U.K. and in Iceland. He has published books in both languages. His first story, The Guilty Boy, was published in The Threepenny Review in 2001 and has since been translated into eight languages.

Based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Carson McCullers, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter tells the story of 12-year-old Mick Kelly, played by a gripping Caldwell, an outcast from her peers who finds solace in her lonely pursuits of music and poetry. Her feelings of alienation intensify after an accident claims the life of her brother, leaving her no longer in her mother, Grace (a fierce DuBose), and her stepfather, Jake (a thoughtful Sneed), whom she cares for more than she does the apathetic alcoholic whom she calls Daddy (a gruffly unapologetic Rogers). Even her father seemingly has little interest in being a good role model for Mick, preferring to spend his time getting drunk at the local bar rather than take responsibility for the responsibilities of fatherhood. Although the adults around her seem to have given up on her, Mick never loses hope for a better life, finding solace in the affection of neighbors John Singer (a fiery Scherer) and Wadie White (an electric Rogers), with whom she shares her passion for poetry and its ability to relieve her loneliness.

2024-09-25 03:22:14,470 - Prompt 133: The chef's secret recipe for the perfect dish
2024-09-25 03:22:14,470 - Generated text: 
When he opens a new restaurant, the celebrity chef Eric Ripert says, the most important thing to him is not the recipes. No, the most important thing is the ingredients. When everything's right, he says, the ingredients do the talking. He lets them, and his talented sous chefs and apprentices, do the work. All he does is help them by buying the best.
The chef buys from local vendors and markets whenever possible. But his game is to mix the very best from around the world, from France to Haiti to Thailand. We can only imagine that when he tastes a perfect bite of food, he would know it the same way he would know the ingredients that went into it.
So then, if we were to ask him about the perfect formula, what would he say?
The perfect food needs the best of every ingredient. The best chefs work their magic, to combine these ingredients in unique, perfect ways. But then, to know if you have the perfect food, you have to taste it. So how to do that? A perfect dish must be tasted by itself. To taste it is to eat it.
But just the best of ingredients and the best of chefs is not enough. You have to make sure the people who taste it are the best, too. Just a beautiful ingredient, tasted by a beginner, will still be a boring dish. But a beautiful ingredient, tasted by a genius, is a work of art.
The chef needs the best ingredients, and the best chefs, and the best tasters, to make the perfect dish.
But, is this good advice for the rest of us?
Not necessarily. Why? Because taste is all important, and we each have our own ideas about what we like. Even if you did your best, and used the finest ingredients, you can't just be sure that you would taste the same, beautiful combination of flavors that the chef might taste. What if you liked his dish, but not in the same way that he liked it?
This is why I like movies. They teach me about cooking, and they teach me about life.
In the movie Chef, the main character is a world-class chef, who has lost touch with what he likes to eat, because he spends all his time taking care of all the other cooks in his restaurants, and tasting all the food, and deciding which is perfect. Finally, he is tasted himself, by a beautiful waitress, who asks him if he really knows how to cook.
He doesn't. He's lost touch. She asks him to help her and her fiance make a perfect dinner. He does. They use the best ingredients. But then she asks him if he really knows how to cook, because she had the real recipe. She lets him help her. He makes some tasty dishes. She tells him that he doesn't know anything. He asks her if she wants to make a perfect dinner, with the best ingredients, and great chefs, and real taste. She says no, she doesn't care. He asks her why she wants to go through all this trouble, to make such a beautiful, perfect dish. She says she wants to learn, and to take care of her family. And he asks her what the secret is, to the perfect dish, and she says, "Salt."
That's the key, to any ingredient, to the dish, and to the life: do you have the best ingredients? Do you let the chef decide what goes in? Do you taste it? Or do you let the others tell you what they like?
As the movie says, "Sometimes you have to risk everything. For what you really love."
When my kids were young, we often watched the Magic School Bus, which teaches about the world by taking a ride in the bus with the professor, and discovering about each place by taking a small detour off the main road.
In one episode, we see the end of the earth. Some penguins live there, in a small group. There is a ship, and inside the ship is the main character of the episode, a man named Mr. Noodle, who has decided to risk everything for love.
There's something at the end of the earth, that no one has ever seen, and Mr. Noodle's going to make the journey, just to see it, to taste it.
He doesn't care about the distance, or the journey, or the risk. He doesn't care about what will happen. He's just

I am very excited about my new game Worlds of Magic: The Card Game. A brand new game designed by the award-winning creator of Last Resort.
I started working on Worlds of Magic: The Card Game in late 2015, soon after I released the all-time best selling indie card game, Extreme Exorcism. Worlds of Magic has been designed for years, and I want to share more information about its features.
Different worlds, different rule sets. How to create a game that contains dozens of different worlds with different rules?! A game like Worlds of Magic, that has dozens of worlds, should use a new game mechanic for each world.
I don’t know how many different rule sets will be in the final game. My hope is to have many rule sets, with different game modes, difficulty levels, and even a theme. I’m thinking that one rule set could be a “story mode”, while another is a “survival mode”. The game will also have unlockable “power-ups” to increase your chances to beat the game.
Each world in Worlds of Magic: The Card Game will have its own set of rules and conditions. This will allow players to try different rulesets, as well as explore different themes.
Each world is being developed by a different game designer. I will feature 30 different worlds, some of them will be very familiar, some will be completely new. All of the designers will sign their work.
Some worlds will feature cards that interact with each other, some cards will be one-time-use cards, some cards will be disposable cards, some cards will be recyclable, some cards will be rare, some cards will be not-so-rare, and the list goes on and on. The cards and their properties will be designed based on the world’s design.
This design will allow a more even distribution of cards, meaning that cards in a game will be the same or close in rarity to cards from the previous game. This will result in a more balanced and challenging game. I’m planning on creating dozens of card sets, and you’ll be able to select the card sets in the game.
For the time being, there will be no expansions. I’m planning on creating dozens of worlds, and not everyone will be sold as an expansion. Instead, the cards will be made available for free as part of the game itself.
The game will feature a storyline, quests, and some other game elements. The storyline and quests will be part of the game, not something you’ll need to purchase as an expansion. The cards in the game will come from different games, but the ones that are not sold as expansions will be available as part of the game itself.
The game will contain different rulesets. The core rules will be a 3-player game, but the game will also feature a 1-player and a 2-player game. This will allow players to choose the ruleset that suits their preferences.
The game will also include a lot of puzzles. Every game world will have a different puzzle. The puzzles will help players understand the rules and the characters.

<i>Falling in Love is Hard to Do</i> is one of the shorts in "G-Force". I can't remember the exact title of this one but I do remember that the short kind of left me a bit indifferent. If the whole movie was the same then I might've hated this short, however, I can't really remember much of the movie, so maybe I did like it. I wouldn't have thought this short to be overly memorable though. It was just a bit dull to me. The idea for this short was a bit dull too. It is just a bit too slow for my liking. This short did have a decent set of CG animation and some good voice acting in it though, I do like the design of the characters in this short too. The music in this short wasn't that good but it wasn't bad either. Overall, this short didn't do anything for me.
It's OK. The rest of the movie, though, is fantastic.
Advocate A Cinema
I really enjoyed this film
There was only one one out of 12 of the movie. It was cute and fairly funny, but the story and the execution was corny.

The water mill, with its large wheel, the miller standing on a bench, pouring water into the mill wheel. The water continuing its movement, driven by gravity, and turning the wheel. The massive wooden wheel, spinning slowly, and grinding the wheat into meal.
Along the shore, a middle aged man was spreading his horse manure. Old ladies with old rosaries were walking along the countryside, dressed in traditional clothes, with a kerchief on their heads.
The bells, chiming on a slow, gentle, regular rhythm. The long and mild summer evening.
When walking in the countryside, you could feel, that summer was near.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,464 - Generated text:  of witchcraft, murder and mystery.
A sudden death brings the Hughes family to the home of wealthy, eccentric Caleb Trask. The remaining family is intent on getting the estate on the open market, where it can be divided into individual sections.
When Sebastian Trask returns, following years of working in the wilderness, the family begins to return, but as a forceful presence, and a growing number of mysterious deaths bring the story to its climax.
Baroness Orczy's classic novel The Ghost Hunters is translated into English from French by Sidney Watson and George Orczy. The novel begins with a businessman, who believes his business to be broken, and seeking a means to restructure his debts. The "White Monk," the leader of a procession of Catholic peasants in gray cloaks, opens the door to the villa.
The Emperor has an edict that no one is to enter the forbidden city, the black monastery, without a writ from the king. But this scoundrel believes himself above the law and plunges into the mysterious land. The ground moves. The monks open their dreadful jaws. A dismal bell tolls. A horrifying voice speaks. A dark hand seizes the impudent one. And his fate is unveiled in a ghastly tableau, representing the last moments of his earthly existence.
The Grey Monk is a mystery and a novel of suspense and horror, filled with swordplay and bloody martyrdom. The tale's title comes from the cemetery and graveyard's monks, who are themselves cloaked in grey. The villain's name, Paganini, is a literal rendition of a story which has its roots in The Life and Adventures of the Famous Musician Nicolo Paganini.
An authentic and unabridged recording from Orczy's well known Gothic Mystery. This is the classic story of a wealthy businessman whose business has gone bankrupt and the sins of his children - who come to a horrible end. A classic horror and mystery novel set in a castle in France. (Summary by Chris Smith)

Excellent story. Narrator needs some coaching. The story could have been much more dramatic with her narration, instead we get bland.
Chris Smith can’t read worth spit. Bumbles over his lines, mispronounces, stumbles, can’t handle different voices. He is like a person who just learned to read off a teleprompter, but without the benefit of one. What an ugly presentation of this otherwise well-written novel. This is not about a person’s politics. It is about how painful it is to listen to a reading like this one. The old-fashioned style of this novel would have been served by a decent reading. RAE MCDIANAL IS MUCH BETTER.

Our country is home to many talented, dedicated and creative people and if we’re to develop our creative economy, it’s our on-screen and behind-the-scenes creative talent that must be nurtured, developed and supported.
That’s why the ACT Government has invested $1.7 million in the Arts and Screen Fund to ensure the Canberra community benefits from our talent and accesses more opportunities to become involved in creating a wide range of screen and arts productions, workshops, festivals and conferences in our city.
The funding will be split equally between the arts and screen sectors and will go towards initiatives like the ACT Creative Canberra fund and the Filmmaking in Schools and Screen Territory programs, which support projects for people with disability, emerging and established arts organisations, and independent filmmakers.
This fund is helping to turn creative ideas into reality, and bring our community together to celebrate our local screen and arts talent.

Imagine if books could actually rewrite history, not just tell you about the past? If you could go back in time to a moment in history and rewrite history? What if you could go back in time and alter the course of the future? This is exactly what Sara is desperately searching for, but when she gets there she finds something even more interesting, something that will completely change her perspective on life. Her story is all part of what we’re starting to call the Storybook Worlds. I think it’s one of the best Storybook Worlds stories I’ve read.
Ethan Shaw is a bit of an eccentric. He makes his living collecting and selling rare and mysterious books that just happen to have a special power: the ability to alter the past. It’s not really that much of a stretch to think that books could actually rewrite history. After all, the Bible does suggest that there were once people who had the power to alter the past, the future and the present. These people were called the Bookmakers.
Jerry Mander is a grumpy old man, a bit of a loner who lives in his cottage and tends to prefer the company of books. It’s not long before he is invited to stay at Ethan’s library. The same day he is staying, Ethan invites him to visit his friend, Ian McGuire, who happens to be a very reclusive and eccentric man. It’s not long before Jerry meets another eccentric, and that eccentric is Ian McGuire, who is also a writer.
I’m really not sure how I came to write this. I’ve never been much of a writer, but I decided to write this story in order to tell a bit of a different story. I’ve always been a big fan of the Bookmakers, and this is something that I’ve always wanted to write. I thought that this would be a really fun book, and that it would give me an opportunity to write something that was really different.
A Thousand Lives is a story of the power of a single book. The story tells of an ancient and powerful relic, a thousand year old manuscript, which has been used for centuries to tell stories about the past.
In a world where every book in the library has its own unique power, the book is used to tell stories of the past.
While the stories that are told are set in the past, there are many stories in the books that take place in the present. In this world, time can be altered and rewritten. But what happens when someone realizes that they are the only one who knows the truth about the power of the books?
Jerry Mander is a librarian who takes care of the library at a small town, where the books are powerful enough to alter time.
In the story, Jerry Mander receives a message from a distant relative that tells him of the book that can alter time, and is given the task of trying to stop the man who’s using the book to alter the past.

- Bestselling Author of the Nanovirus and Cyborg books
I didn’t think it was possible for a man to burn up as fast as lightning and still get out of bed the next morning. The fire had burned the skin on my face and on the back of my neck off. I have big ears and the top of my head has a good-sized hole burned through it. The sockets where my eyes used to be are now dull metal cylinders that face forward with no way of blinking. There are scars on my head and hands where I tried to grab the wires to the robotic arm that were now in the hands of the person that had murdered me.
No, I had not fallen asleep yet. I felt the strong electrical shocks to my head. The shocks followed my cranial nerves, forcing my eye sockets to blink and my ears to wiggle. The memory of the ordeal I had been through forced my vision to swim.
I knew then that I was not a dead man. The doctors were correct in their diagnosis of a coma. I was alive, but I was not human anymore. I had been modified. That day would become the first day of my life as a cyborg, a mechanical man, a bionic man.
Once I was healed and the modifications were complete, the doctors, scientists and lawyers who tried to murder me returned to work. Their final objective was my transfer to the United States of America, where I would be an employee of the Federal Government.
Dr. Patricia Pollard, the scientist in charge of my team, ran the office and was the point person for the decisions I made regarding my experiments and research.
“Ryan, I’m looking for your decision on several of the projects in the development process,” said Dr. Pollard.
The task of choosing between research projects was one of the biggest responsibilities of my job. Some people thought I chose projects to enhance my career, which is why I made so many trips to different parts of the world. I had chosen to travel around the globe looking for the right places to research new projects for the company. I had traveled from England to Germany, France to Italy, and from Egypt to Turkey.
“What is the budget on the United Kingdom project?”
“What is the timeline?”
“Is the Turkey project a continued project, or are you in the planning stages for a new one?”
Dr. Pollard’s questions made me think of the project that led to me being injured and the demise of Dr. Koenig’s assistant, David, in a hotel room in Manhattan.
“I want the development team to focus on the Cybernetic Man development project. I think it will make the biggest impact on the company.”
The brain enhancement project had been my focus, but I did not feel like the project was moving forward at the pace I needed to bring it to completion. Other projects had become top priorities with the possible addition of a new division in a different country.
“We’ll have a meeting to discuss the project proposal and see if we can’t clear some hurdles. It is the final week for the research project.”
“The timeline is short.”
“Yes, that is what I mean by it being the final week. Can we postpone the meeting until next week?”
I did not like how much time I was spending on administrative tasks for the company. I knew what I was hired for, to do research, not paperwork.
“The meeting will take place at eleven o’clock tomorrow morning. I’m heading to lunch now. Are you going to stay in the office today?”
“I’ll stay, just to make sure things don’t go crazy.”
“That’s great, Ryan. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.”
I felt the wave of nausea as I got up from my chair and headed out of the office. I was tired

Prior to the publication of this book, from 1867 to 1993, there were only two validated animal portraits that had been made by humans on six continents, the first being the gorilla illustration by Emile, first de Savigny (see Chapter 6) and the second a boy's drawings of antelope, penguins, birds, and other animals by Harold Horace Wright, a resident of Antarctica for 34 years. In January of 1995, the long-term viability of only one of the two validated animal portraits was endangered when the temperature in California rose above 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of the sun-scorched surface of Mercury. Tragically, the laboratory where the E. coli bacteria DNA strands were being synthesized for cloning was destroyed by the heat. So ended any possibility of the kind of scientific speculation that would be necessary to clone the long-gone artistic creations of scientists from the Victorian period, or those who might try to accomplish what Emile de Savigny did 133 years before it became possible.
According to the authoritative _British Museum Natural History_ , which we've relied upon for a good deal of our research and reporting, the "establishment" of the gorilla was accomplished by E. de Savigny. Emile, first de Savigny, was born in Paris in 1801. He was a French medical doctor, a naval surgeon, and a naturalist, specializing in studies of vertebrate zoology. He spent the first 10 years of his career in South America. It was here in South America that he met, and took, the sketches that later became the basis of the first published illustrations of a living gorilla, an animal that had previously been reputed to be a myth. On March 28, 1840, de Savigny made a crucial discovery on the Equator, that is, a discovery that was entirely by chance. He was part of an expedition that was returning to Europe from French colonies in Côte d'Ivoire. For the entire voyage, his chief concerns had been with contracting a tropical disease or sustaining a physical injury. The French Navy's physician had prescribed a "lethal dose of quinine." De Savigny assumed he'd soon be dead.
But he wasn't. On March 28, 1840, his ship was anchored near the mouth of the Sanchez River, west of Lake N'Goroba, a tributary of the Kouilou River in central Africa, about 30 miles southeast of the capital of the Congo. The river is also called the Congo River and is currently Africa's second-longest river, after the Nile. The Congo River's drainage basin is some 10 percent larger than that of the Nile. De Savigny became involved in a strange little enterprise of trading. A fellow passenger aboard the ship was a European merchant who had recently acquired a musket and 2,000 beads, to trade with locals. A few days before, de Savigny had gone ashore to interview several local tribal leaders, but he had left his musket behind in the village of the slavers. When the merchant and the trading captain made land, the merchants distributed the 2,000 beads among the Africans.
What happened next, according to de Savigny, was not as he had planned. De Savigny was unaware that his musket had been captured by some villagers, and that his 2,000 beads had been taken away from him. However, he had been invited to share in the feast that was being prepared by the villages that were not part of the region controlled by the slavers. He said he drank a quantity of palm wine "beyond a reasonable amount," and he soon felt dizzy and disoriented. He thought he was going to die. He came to after falling asleep. But his memories were not so clear as to whether or not he had been badly beaten and robbed by the slavers.
In an explanation of how his encounter was reported, de Savigny said, "During this voyage my chief interests were caught up in the administration of quinine... I was sick

Ozzy Vandenwalle in conversation with Henk Oosthuizen of CNBC Africa
You may not know his name, but you probably know the brands he has co-founded – such as AAA, Edcon, TFG, Mr Price, Currys and, most recently, StoreHippo – and you almost certainly have benefited from one of his retail concepts.
There are only a handful of successful retailers in South Africa who can boast such a diverse portfolio of successful businesses – but, what many do not know is that Vandenwalle is equally passionate about changing the world. “I’ve been at a meeting or two where we have discussed how we can contribute towards the SDGs (sustainable development goals). I have had the opportunity to contribute to a few projects and I am still very keen to get involved in more projects where we can make a difference. For me, it’s not about winning a race. I want to help as many people as possible, and I want to have as large an impact as possible. I love meeting people and hearing what they have to say. My goal is to find a way of taking all of my ideas and bringing them to the people who can use them,” he says.
In 2018, Vandenwalle took a major decision and announced his retirement from Edcon, his most successful business venture to date. However, the founder of the popular retail group was hardly about to slow down. He reiterated his commitment to his love for startups and changing the world, and gave us a glimpse of his plans for the future.
“One of the best parts of what I do is to be able to mentor and coach young entrepreneurs. I work with different companies and my mentorship is always free – as is my time and energy.
“I like to help young entrepreneurs. I love to see the way in which they view the world. They often have different ideas, but there are a lot of people who will help them with their business plans. I want to help them with their visions for their business. I can really add value to them and their ideas.
“With regard to the SDGs, one of the things I am really passionate about is something I refer to as ‘Trusted Growth’. It’s something that we have been building into all our businesses, and that has contributed to our success. We’ve always done things properly, we’ve always done the right things.
“‘Trusted Growth’ is not only a way for us to build a sustainable business, but it is also the way in which we can make a meaningful contribution to the development of our society. And, one of the things we do is to try to give as much back as we can to society. We’ve been doing this for over 20 years. I really hope that in the next few years we can scale up our contribution to society and that we can become more involved in the SDGs.
“We can do so much more, but, of course, we need partners who want to be involved in projects such as these. We have lots of partners who want to contribute to the SDGs and who want to be involved with us. They want to work with us, and that’s fantastic. It makes it very easy for us.
“When we talk about these initiatives and new projects, I tell all of the entrepreneurs, young and old, that there is no reason for them not to do things that are sustainable and make an impact on the environment and on society. It doesn’t take much effort or extra money to implement sustainability or impact projects. If you really put your mind to it, you will be surprised at how you can make a huge difference in the world.
“These days, young people are very conscious about what they do, where they do it, and who they do it with. Everyone can make a difference in this world. We cannot rely on our governments to take care of everything. Everyone can contribute. Everyone can help. The next generation knows this and they are putting pressure on governments to do more. They are also putting pressure on companies to do more.
“It’s a new approach – this new way of looking at things. It’s important. People want to do the right thing and people want to do more than they have in the past. We as companies need to recognise this and respond to it.
“I have been in the business for many years and, for a long time, I thought that what I could do would have a limited impact on the world. But it’s not like that. I can only hope to build up

If I took that, they’d all be dead.
We made it look like we were fighting and ran away.
While hiding behind trees, werewolves from the other families came out to hunt.
Javier, who was one of the weaker humans, turned into a werewolf and had to fight them.
I have a headache. Mom, my body hurts.
It was getting harder and harder for her to hear his heartbeat.
Her heart ached as she saw the looks in his eyes that said “I’m dying.
After returning to the castle, my Momma said that you can stay in the castle for now.
But we can’t hide in here forever, can we? My little brother will get hurt too if the werewolves come here.
And because of Javier’s headache, I’m going to feed him some of my blood now.
I don’t know if I can save my little brother or not.
I just hope he won’t have to suffer.
But still… it’s not safe… being in the same room together… I’m worried about my mom.
She is younger than my dad and my little brother.
How can she take care of her children on her own when she’s sick like this?
All I can do is stay here in the castle and wait for them to show up.
It seems that the old castle will soon be filled with mist.
What if my little brother and I are killed by werewolves?
When the sun rises and the moon sets, the werewolves will gather together in the ruins of the old castle to turn into humans again.
They will be heading for the hospital, not knowing about the death of Javier and me.
My mom, dad and little brother are safe.
The werewolves who were attacked by my parents are all dead.
Now my parents are taking my little brother and me to the hospital.
Even though the werewolves who attacked me are dead, I still feel like I’m not okay.
Now I’m in the hospital with my mom and little brother.
Dad and my little brother are still in the car outside.
He said that he would be here by the next morning.
I have a bad headache again.
My mom said that there’s no more blood left in the hospital.
My little brother and I will be left alone at the hospital.
But I have something for you.
I can’t hold it in anymore. I want to tell you what’s on my mind.
I want you to remember me.
I want to be remembered.
My mom said that we should come back and see you.
But I don’t think we can go back there.
But I don’t think we can stay here either.
You said that I could stay with you.
But now I don’t know what to do anymore.
I can’t go back to the castle or I’ll lose everything.
But I also don’t know if I can stay here at the hospital either.
My dad and my little brother are on the way to come see me.
I have to think about this some more.
My mom said that we should come back here.
I don’t think I can stay here for too long.
But I can’t go back to the castle.
I’m not sure what’s going to happen next.
I want to protect you. But I can’t.
I can’t stay here in the hospital either.
My little brother and I will be staying with you.
I don’t want to see my little brother get hurt.
I hope that you will protect him.
I hope that you will be there for him.
And I hope that you will be there for me too.
My little brother is the only family that I have left.
I’m not sure what’s going to happen to me now that I’m staying with you.
I’m worried about my little brother.
I can’t see the stars anymore.
I can’t see anything anymore.
I can’t even see the moon anymore.
I don’t want to die. I want to live.
I want to be there for my little brother.
I don’t want to lose him.
I don’t want to leave him behind.
I don’t want to leave my mom and my dad behind.
I don’t want to lose my little brother.
I don’t want to lose my little brother’s love.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,465 - Prompt 11: The detective pondered over the clues, which
2024-09-25 03:24:48,465 - Generated text:  were vital in solving the crime. Only someone from a reputed lawyer firm, which had the required knowledge of the law, could be given such a challenging case. However, it was difficult to be certain that anyone from the firm was capable of solving such a case. Fortunately, he came across a name; Smitty. The first name he remembered hearing the previous day. He turned to his desk and dialled the number. “Hi, this is Detective Murphy,” he said, “I need a quick favour.”
“You can ask whatever you want,” replied Smitty, “Just name it.”
“It’s not that simple,” said the detective, “but I’ll try and give you a gist of it.”
“Okay,” said Smitty, “I’m listening.”
“This is a murder case and the victim is a lawyer, living in Brooklyn,” began Murphy, “Now, I need to verify the contents of a letter, which was supposed to be a will.”
“What was written in the will?” asked Smitty, “Anything which would have raised suspicion?”
“Well, there is nothing like that,” replied Murphy, “The man simply asked his wife to look after their daughter and give her the best education possible. I doubt if anyone can doubt the mother’s sincerity.”
“How old is their daughter?” asked Smitty.
“She’s just two,” replied Murphy, “But her mother is responsible enough to handle her.”
“I’m not saying anything against her,” began Smitty, “but do you have any idea what exactly you want from me?”
“No,” replied Murphy, “I don’t want to rush into anything, but I’m interested in your thoughts on the subject. The case is very complex, so I’d be glad if you could throw some light on it.”
“Sure,” replied Smitty, “I’ll call you back in the evening.”
“Thanks,” replied Murphy, “it’ll be a great help.”
Murphy returned to his office and ruminated over the case. The circumstances suggested that there was more to the murder than what the lawyers were willing to disclose. It was unlikely that the couple was just feuding over a disputed will. There was something that the family was hiding. Murphy wished he could get hold of the victim’s daughter, and make her relate the whole story. It would be far better than accepting the story from the mother. It might be true, but would it be complete? There was also a possibility that it was a planned murder and the daughter was chosen for some other reason. However, he was unable to reveal his thoughts to Smitty, as he didn’t want to give her more information than she already had. He would give her only what was necessary to understand his point of view.
The afternoon was devoted to meeting a number of people, whose contact numbers he didn’t possess. The dining tables at his office were overwhelmed with files which, he realised, he would be able to utilise for solving the case. However, the members of the couple’s firm appeared to be in complete denial. The first two he met were unable to state anything but the truth. However, when he spoke to the senior partners, the situation started changing. He wished to meet someone from their family, but didn’t have time to do so. His last client of the day wanted to discuss something with him, so he had to rush back to his office.
The man Murphy met in his office was Fletcher, who was known for his miserly behaviour and extremely irritating style of speech. His visits to the office were always unexpected, and it was a sheer pleasure to meet him. Murphy had heard of him from other lawyers, who had dubbed him as a miserly person, who kept an eye on every penny he earned. His profession demanded that he should have earned a good amount, but what Murphy had heard about him was completely contrary. The man on the other side of the desk had a lot of respect for Murphy’s knowledge and abilities. He could understand the importance of what the other had to say, and his feelings towards the other were completely different from what the others had portrayed.
“You are a very good lawyer,” he said, as Murphy was about to give him the bill.
“Thanks for the compliment,” smiled Murphy, “I always enjoy working with you.”
“My pleasure,” smiled Fletcher, “but I have some work for you.”
“Always ready to do something,” smiled Murphy, “But just tell me.”

Her characters love cheese. And it’s safe to say that she does as well.

1 thought on “Dungeon Quest (2022)”
Either you escape or become a monster.. So, a trade off. It's worth to sacrifice one day of your life to solve a virtual game but you don't know what is going on, if there is any progress or what the game objective is.
The actors really do their best to present some body language, emotions and characters. The movie is very entertaining to watch. I rate 7.8/10. This movie is addictive. You will be chasing some players trying to help them escape, by taking chances that you get into same game, so more people will die.
But wait, I had doubts while watching it. If this is a virtual game, and the alien monster was making kids in lab, what's the point of sacrificing yourself? Let's save someone else instead. Maybe this is not virtual game. You die for real or just become part of virtual world?
Anyway, if you want to have fun, watch it. It's easy to predict but still exciting. Even some chases are fun. I enjoyed a lot and surprised. I had the idea this was going to be some drama about suicide or drama about kids facing a monster. None of it happened.
If you have Netflix, you should not miss this one.

One night, Odie Elkins dreams of being whisked into the worst book he’s ever read, The Princess in the Opal Mask, where he meets Princess Gwyn of Fairyland and the story’s villain, Countess Limmeridge. It’s up to Odie to protect the characters in his dreams, but can he save the book and wake up?
Leave a Comment on Book Review: The Princess in the Opal Mask by Jenny Lundquist
I received an early copy of this book from the author in exchange for a review and I cannot thank her enough for it. As this was an early copy, I can’t guarantee that any quotes I use from this review will be accurate to the final copy of the book.
Odie Elkins is on the precipice of his Junior year of high school. While his best friend Sam is busy living his dream of working with the ghost of an old woman to find a missing diamond, Odie has resigned himself to being the wallflower of his school. A reader, an avid reader of fantasy novels, he’s not interested in sports or social clubs. He’s fine with that.
He’s also in love with Natalie, the most popular girl in school. Natalie, who likes sports, who doesn’t spend time in the library, who…nevermind. Odie can’t talk to her. If only Sam could help him out, though! Sam’s cute, shy, but always stands up for himself when he needs to. Natalie likes him, right? So does Odie. But there are bigger things afoot than just breaking the social norms of high school. Odie, while at the beach with his parents, dreams about a castle, with a young prince…
Then Sam gets a call. An old woman, who’s been invisible to her grandson, is visible now, and they need Sam’s help. Odie insists on coming along. This is an adventure he’s always wanted. But he’s not prepared for the adventure that’s going to happen in his next dream.
Odie will become friends with Princess Gwyn. And will have to stand up for her. Against the enemy of the kingdom. Someone very close to Odie. Someone Odie has to save. He has to stop a magical library from consuming its readers. He has to protect Princess Gwyn. And he has to convince Natalie to stand by his side.
In The Princess in the Opal Mask, I think I’m going to review this book in two ways. I’m going to review it from Odie’s point of view. And then from Natalie’s. Odie is…who I have to be honest, he’s not the most compelling of narrators. He can be a bit of a self-insert. He’s not witty. He’s not a favorite of mine. At all. But that’s not going to be a reflection on how I felt about the book. I don’t even know if that’s because he’s a character, or because I am. I think I’ve always been like that. But while I don’t care for Odie, I do like how he stood up for Princess Gwyn. I also like the friendship he forms with Sam, who has more patience with Odie and his dreaming than anyone else in his life. I do not like how Odie is so into Natalie, who could not be any more different from Odie. I get that they’re the popular girl and the underdog. But I don’t get the feelings he has for her. She’s not that interesting of a character, and he needs someone who will stand by him. Instead, he’s so worried about what people think of him. He’s not likable. So what does he do? He believes the false reality of his dreams. But I think that his biggest strength is that he does stand up for others.
But you know what? I’ve had this conversation with people about books. I read books, and I get caught up in the story. I forget I’m the reader. I forget what’s real and what’s not real. I’ve even said that I didn’t care that I was reading about characters who weren’t real. That’s why I think Odie is so compelling, even if I don’t care for him as a character. It’s the same for me with movies.
Natalie, on the other hand, I loved. She wasn’t the typical popular girl. But I’m willing

Last year, an acquaintance of mine (Jay) told me that he had taken an unusual trip to Africa. He was in the midst of some very deep turmoil in his life, so he told me. He said that his journey to Africa was like a pilgrimage.
Jay never once traveled to Africa for fun. He also had no money, he said. He had a very small pension, but he wanted to travel to a village in Africa where medicine could not help him. He wanted to find a mystic or shaman or someone who had special powers.
Jay's healing was remarkable.
My friend and I met each other in college. He's my age, but he's considerably younger than me. He says I'm a very slow reader. It's true. I don't read books very quickly. I've never really been interested in the more popular types of literature. I don't like to write novels or memoirs. But I love mysteries and science fiction. I like fantasy novels, too. And I love history.
If you're reading this story, then you probably know how I feel about mystery and science fiction.
I've always felt that I was born in the wrong era. I've always wanted to go back to the future. I wish I could go back to the past, to a time before I was born. I wish I could find an ancient tomb and read the wisdom of the great scientists, philosophers, and philosophers.

After making her landfall, she abandons the sea and seeks a life on dry land.
Upon arriving, Neptunea comes to a fork in the road. On one side, she sees a long coral reef. The other a shoal of fish. Neptunea cannot decide which way to go. Then Neptunea hears a familiar call of Neotrygon kuhlii. Heading in the direction of the sound, Neptunea finds many of Neotrygon kuhlii congregated together. Now she realizes where she has landed.
Neptunea's background in science and genetics causes her to become fascinated by the deep sea life around her.
Neptunea stares up into the glowing abyss of the night sky.
Not wanting to be alone, Neptunea wakes up the town of St. Thomas.
Often she will lure a young male sting ray with a freshly cracked open coconut. After he has eaten the sweet coconut, he will go to Neptunea and mate with her. Neptunea continues her lifestyle. She was only a pawn of her abusive father's, Neptune [NOTE]. But she now lives for herself.
Neptunea, or her third name - Neptune's blossom - is the name of this photo. It shows Neptunea after a few years. She is a much bigger, more curvaceous woman.
She not only lives on dry land, but builds her own house.
The name "blossom" refers to her being fully grown.
She decides she must return to the deep sea and her old life. After her death, her body will be returned to the deep sea by the waters of the ocean, as it was intended.

Tricia sat in the corner of the sauna, the only spot away from the main door.
"It's not a bad spot," Tricia commented. She was feeling somewhat better. She had survived her first sauna.
"I couldn't leave you here alone," said Kyle. "What if you passed out and I wasn't here to help you?"
"Oh, don't worry," Tricia said. "I had my phone and I'm sure someone would have been in the locker room, in case I fainted or whatever."
"Well, you're a tough woman," Kyle said. "You're going to be okay."
"Yeah," Tricia replied. "I'm tough."
"I'm sorry," Kyle said. "I should have told you that this was all voluntary. I know it wasn't fair. You don't have to sit in the sauna."
"Oh, it's okay," Tricia said. "I don't mind it. It's kind of funny to hear that everyone's doing the same thing I'm doing. It gives me something to relate to."
"All right," Kyle said. "You're going to have to make the best of it."
"No problem," Tricia said. She leaned back on the wooden bench and rested her feet against the cool cement floor. She closed her eyes.
"It's your mother again," she said, taking the phone from her pocket.
"Dear, I don't think your friend here is going to appreciate the two calls you made to me," Mrs. Lewis said.
"I wasn't planning on staying long," Tricia replied. "I'll be there tonight."
"You'll be here when the school band plays a concert in the auditorium?"
"Not really," Tricia said. "You see, I'm stuck in here."
"Stuck?"
"Yeah," Tricia said. "It's not really bad. Kyle's pretty nice."
"Oh," Mrs. Lewis said. "Is he in there with you?"
"Um, no," Tricia said. "No, he's outside. Listen, Mom, I'll be there for the concert."
"No, I think you will not," Mrs. Lewis said. "Listen to me, Tricia. You will be there. If not, I'm coming down to fetch you."
"I promise, Mom," Tricia said. "I'll be there."
"All right," Mrs. Lewis said. "Be there or else."
"All right," Tricia said. "Bye."
She turned off the phone. Tricia held the phone in her hand. Then she dropped it on the cement floor.
"That's the fifth time this morning," Tricia said to herself.
It had been the same with her locker. Mrs. Lewis had ranted and raved and thrown a fit each time she saw Tricia.
Now Tricia knew why. She knew that her mother wasn't pleased about the fact that Tricia had changed her mind about going back to Lewis High. That wasn't the only reason. Mrs. Lewis also didn't approve of the fact that Tricia was with Kyle instead of her cousin, Liz.
And when Kyle tried to open the locker, Tricia was so nervous that she had locked it and thrown the keys away. Luckily, the janitor had found them.
And now here she was in the sauna, listening to Kyle's wonderful, soft jazz. It wasn't uncomfortable. Tricia sat back and took a deep breath.
"What happened to you?" Kyle said.
"I think I just fainted," Tricia replied. "It was just too hot and I think I lost my breath. I'm sorry I missed that basketball game last night."
"Don't worry about it," Kyle said. "We have a game on Thursday night, anyway. I'm sure you'll be there for that."
"Yeah," Tricia said. "Don't worry about me, Kyle."
She tried to act normal. She made a pretend smile on her face. She didn't want Kyle to know what had happened.
But what if her mother found out?
Tricia looked around the steam-filled room. What if Mrs. Lewis came through that door? What if she saw Tricia with

Seeing as how this will be the first webcomic Siddell’s ever published, he wants to give everyone a chance to familiarize themselves with it before diving right in. “The goal here is to produce a graphic novel that has a consistent look,” he says. “I think that's one of the things that makes the internet a little intimidating, and also one of the things that a webcomic really has to excel at, is having an identity.”

Welcome to Everyday Heroes,
My name is Tom Siddell, and I’m a cartoonist. Now, let me start off by saying that this will not be a blog about that! As much as I would love to tell you about my process, or about the things that are upcoming, or about anything else having to do with me or my work, this will be more of an announcement post. (No, not for a sequel! The current Everyday Heroes storyline will actually be about four episodes long.) So I’ll save the fun for another day.
But that’s not to say that this won’t be a place to come back to. I will try to make this blog relevant to the storyline from time to time, and more importantly, this is a blog! It’s my first real one, and it’s so exciting! I may go into it with the mindset that it will be for comics-related stuff, but with that much freedom I may end up writing a travelogue, or a caption contest, or even a story of my own!

Suzanne is not very good at haunting, and in her latest effort she's decided to scare away a little girl from her tree house. However, the only thing Suzanne can do is yell very loudly, and the child is still happily playing away, oblivious to her new ghostly friend.
Convinced that she can do better, Suzanne decides to enter the Ghostly Races—a competition where ghosts are judged on their ability to make mortals jump in their graves—hoping that a win will impress her mentor and her parents. But before she can register for the races, Suzanne comes face-to-face with an old friend—the ghost of her cat, Sugar Paw, who died a year ago.
Sugar Paw explains that ghosts in the afterlife can pass through objects but cannot affect humans, and Suzanne is desperate to pass Sugar Paw's test and show her that she is a real ghost. Armed with her book of Ghost Rules and a lot of willingness to bend them, Suzanne attempts to improve her haunting skills and inadvertently sets up an epic battle between mortals and ghosts—a battle that could decide whether or not they are able to continue living on in this world.
I find a lot of YA ghost novels unimaginative and generic but this one was truly a fun, laugh out loud read. Suzanne was a delightful character that my heart ached for as she was completely unaware of how the world saw her. At the beginning I was worried that her blind faith in her parents and the afterlife meant that she was being bullied by Sugar Paw but her growth was so rewarding. The Ghostly Races was a fun idea and a very creative plot. I enjoyed that these were based on the hauntings actually occurring (aside from the skeletons of course) as it added a little bit of suspense. There was one thing I was a little sad about as I thought the ending was perfect, I wished it was the last chapter so I could read one more. Overall though, this is a must read for this time of year.
Would I Recommend This Book: Yup! It was a fun read.
How Many Stars: Four out of Five
When a mysterious new boy arrives and starts making trouble in the city, Sam, with his friends -- an ogre, a witch, a growly tiger and a timid ghost -- must unravel the secrets of the boy's past before their town is destroyed in this darkly funny, magical adventure.
Some towns have dragons, and some have ogres. Some towns have zombies. Some towns have giant seaweed monsters. And then there's Camford - which has ogres, a tiger, a witch, and a boy with no name.
Sam hates his name. And he hates even more the fact that his parents have left him to live with his strange Uncle Jack, whose house is far more beautiful than it is cosy.
As soon as Sam moves into his new room, a mysterious boy arrives on the doorstep, asking for Uncle Jack. Sam is horrified that his uncle might leave with the intruder, so he stays up all night to keep an eye on them. Then something strange begins to happen - Uncle Jack is starting to look younger, and the boy is looking increasingly familiar. As the boy starts to question Uncle Jack, Sam must put everything on the line to protect the strange boy he's taken under his wing.
Brimming with dry humour, heart and wonder, The Boy with No Name is a darkly funny and magical adventure that marks the beginning of a brilliant new series by Will Hill.
This story started off very interesting but eventually the premise of the story became too complicated and the ending was a little too obvious. I'm all about suspense but the mystery was a little too easy to figure out and then when it did, I found the explanation frustrating. I liked the characters but I didn't feel a lot of attachment to them. The world and culture was rich and fascinating and I loved the touches of magic but I felt like all that was used to distract from the plot as a whole. I was so confused at the end of this book and not just because I didn't understand exactly what had happened. I had loved the first part and that is why

Billy West wrote and starred in this animated short. A young stork is urged to be independent by his mother, who has not seen her son since he left the nest. To further encourage him, the old lady steals his hat and coat. After a storm, young Willy stumbles upon a shipwreck, where he meets Captain Henry Jekyll, an old stork from Antarctica. One of Jekyll's charges, Erik, a walrus, is giving Willy a tough time. That night, when Erik is sleeping peacefully, Willy dons his stolen garb and impersonates the walrus, chasing Captain Jekyll and his other penguin charges away from their frozen island. En route, they come across a shipwreck and agree to adopt some of the penguins, plant palm trees, and open a resort on the tropical island. Upon arriving at the resort, the crewmates are shocked to learn the walrus tricked them into adopting a small number of penguins. The captain apologizes to the penguins and leaves the new resort, leaving Willy in charge.

Suddenly, Chacha is jolted awake by a familiar but frightening sound: 1,2,3... 1,2,3... 1,2,3... 1,2,3... 1,2,3. . . . The sound comes faster, louder, from all directions. Chacha bolts from the river, tripping on his bandage and landing headfirst in the mud. He groans in pain and anger as he sits up. Through the trees, he sees the creatures emerging from the darkness.
Behind him, a band of teenagers appear on the opposite shore, their legs clattering down the muddy bank. Chacha is startled to see that they are women. The brunette takes one look at him, grimaces, and walks away. Chacha stumbles to his feet and slogs to shore.
The leader, a blonde wearing a tutu, comes to a halt at the water's edge.
"I thought I told you not to follow us," she says.
"You did," Chacha responds. "But I'm not following you. I'm just going swimming."
"What?" She frowns. "It's too cold."
"Yes," he says, "but it's too early to sleep. If I don't start moving, I might die from boredom."
The leader sighs.
"I'm going to have to put you in the pen," she says.
"A pen?"
She snaps her fingers. As she does so, her brunette sister appears out of nowhere, as if she has been summoned by magic. Chacha isn't sure what to make of this, but he senses that these girls have the power to harm him. He would rather sleep than listen to the things they will say, so he scrambles back to shore and clambers onto a rock. He sits with his feet dangling in the water, watching the girls' receding shadows.
"This will be interesting," the leader says.
"He's completely delusional," the brunette says. "You can't be talking about this idiot. He's just a boy."
"That's true, but what a pathetic little life he lives. Even so, he has a death wish, and if he's killed, the penalty is too harsh. We're going to have to keep him alive and ensure that he doesn't try to hurt anyone."
"But that's what we wanted! If we let him live, won't he kill again?"
The leader frowns. "All right, but I'm warning you. He has to be watched, or there'll be hell to pay."
Chacha studies the women as they retreat. The leader seems angry and resigned, her head held high as if to fight back. The brunette looks bored, as if she doesn't even care about what's happening. The final girl, the blonde in the tutu, has a wistful expression, almost as if she's sorry for Chacha.
Before Chacha can turn his thoughts back to the river, he hears someone singing. He looks over his shoulder and sees a man carrying an acoustic guitar playing in the distance. Chacha's heart sinks. The man is pretty good, but it's not the same.
The voice becomes louder, closer. The musician stands by the water, and the moon reflects in his pupils. He is young, but his face is old. As he approaches, Chacha realizes that he can see right through him.
The man stops by the water and sets his guitar down. He looks up at the moon, tracing its outline with his fingers. Then he turns and sees Chacha. He blinks, and his eyes glow red.
"Well, well, well, if it isn't Raccoon, our most wanted murderer," he says. "You got a death wish, I see."
"He did it in a fit of madness!" a woman's voice shouts from the darkness. Chacha recognizes the speaker as the brunette.

It seemed to wreck upon the side of the road.
Many men ran to assist the elderly driver.
The man was nearly ninety years old.
His car looked in good condition.
Everybody wanted to know his name.
“What is it you do here?” one asked.
The man was known as Jay. He was an old-timer of this city. Many knew him and he had many friends.
“I run errands for all the good citizens in this fine town.” The elderly man told the curious onlookers.
Jay got in his car and began to drive away.
Some of the onlookers called for the cop, but he was busy with another call.
Jay drove for miles and miles, not knowing where he was going. He stopped at a small café and asked for directions.
Jay drove the car home and looked up at the house.
He ran inside to his wife. “Come quick my love, there is someone here that needs your help.” He grabbed his wife by her arm.
He pushed her into the truck, closed the door, and started the engine.
He and his wife drove to the home of a very sick man, this man was named Ian.
Jay and his wife got out of the truck. They knocked on the door.
Ian was lying in his bed, his eyes never open, it was as if he was asleep, but his heart stopped many times during the night.
His wife called for the doctor. She was frantic. “Oh, doctor, I can’t bare to loose my husband.” The poor woman cried.
Ian had always been sick, and he was about to lose his life.
The doctor came running. “What is wrong?” he asked.
Ian’s wife said that her husband needed help, he was afraid of death.
The doctor ran to the bedside of Ian and began to examine him. “Don’t worry, he will be fine.” The doctor told his wife.
“That is great news, doctor. Thank you so much. Thank you for helping my husband.” The wife said, as tears flowed down her face.
“You are welcome. I am glad to be of help.” The doctor told her, as he left the house.
“I am going to the store to pick up some things for dinner.” Ian’s wife told him, as she turned and left the house.
Ian layed in his bed, he closed his eyes, and he never opened them again.
Ian’s wife ran to the door and started to cry. “Jay! Jay!” she yelled.
Ian’s wife started to walk down the stairs.
“What are you doing? Don’t come down here.” Jay yelled.
Jay lifted up the stair rail, walked down the steps, and placed his hand upon his wife’s shoulder. “It’s okay, everything will be alright.” Jay told her.
Jay helped his wife up the stairs and into his arms.
“I love you, my darling.” Jay said to his wife.
Jay walked outside the house, and placed his wife back on her feet. “Don’t worry about the car.” Jay said.
Jay closed the door, got into his car, and drove away.
Jay drove down the open road, he drove for miles and miles.
“Jay! Jay!” his wife called out.
“I am going to get you some pills.” Jay told her.
His wife got her prescription, and began to drive home.
The sun was almost setting, as she pulled into her driveway.
Ian’s wife got out of the car and walked to her bedroom.
Her husband never moved in his bed, it was as if he was dead, but he was still breathing.
“Jay! Jay!” his wife called out.
“Please don’t leave me alone, please!” She told him.
“I won’t leave you alone, I promise you.” Jay said.
Jay took his wife by the arm, as they walked into the kitchen.
Jay poured two cups of coffee. He looked over to his wife. “Are you okay?” he asked.
“Yes, I am just fine.” She said.
Jay sat his wife down and handed her a cup of coffee.
Jay sat down beside his wife and they began to drink their coffee.
“I love you too, Jay.” His wife said.

The largest animals are too small to see, but when researchers shine a flashlight onto the seabed, these organisms can suddenly be found. Similar is the discovery in underground gold mines where their stalactites cover the walls and, at least, one animal lives, although barely, in pitch darkness.
Also in real estate, darkness has played an important role for centuries. It is by creating obstacles that real estate is divided into more valuable parts than larger plots. In 2015, the Warming Amendment has put an end to the commonly known procedure of dividing land into larger and smaller parts with even gates. In the new norm, both the A18 and the “counting lane” are becoming rare phenomena in newly built residential areas.
The sixteen constructions in the exhibition unite these two seemingly unrelated fields: the dark areas of a city and those of a new construction project. Construction sites create a fascinating analogy to wilderness areas, as both are characterized by constructions, materials, tools and machines. The inhabitants of both areas follow and enforce rules, conventions and regulations, and both are marked out by fences and boundaries.
What is the relationship between unseen darkness and underground darkness? Is there such a thing as a non-lit area in a city? Which does not appear in new residential areas either? The installation of Rokhaia Miled as well as the film by Rebekka Jonevret take us to places where this comes to mind. A work by the Berlin-based Finnish artist Vesa Kivinen also engages with these questions, while the Romanian artist Ștefăniță Popescu takes us into the underground darkness of a gold mine.
All parts of the exhibition are united by the motto “hidden”: Where do you hide? Where do you go when you are not seen? How can you remain hidden?

The title of the exhibition and the two main elements are inspired by a sound installation created by Anselm Reyle: The Dormitory. In the installation, a speaker at the top of a wooden frame records beeps of white noise from a radio frequency of the same frequency as the sleep rhythm of people. The sound is transmitted via a wireless headset, so it only comes to the attention of the listeners when they are already “in bed” and starting to fall asleep. The dark area is thus used as a space of refraction and consideration, while the sound also leads to the realization that we always stay active in order to be able to fall asleep.

The route started and ended in the little village of Lagundo, a ten minute drive from the coastal city of Cernobbio. I set out early and had a pleasant 10km warm up with the first third of the route in the valley, over relatively flat but curvy and twisty roads. Once the road started heading uphill into the mountains though I could really feel that first layer of racing weight, cold, and tired legs from the two weeks I just spent in Italy. The sun started warming me as I moved through small villages and past tiny farm houses to be rewarded with larger views once I hit the top of the hill in Valle San Felice.
After this initial section of up and down I settled into a steady and brisk climb for about 30km. The nice weather was just starting to turn hot and the road was hot too. The cobblestones under the red hot sun were not fun to traverse. I was only able to stand about half of them so I kept climbing for a few kilometers on the tarmac road next to the river and vineyards.
Finally the road levelled off and I turned into Lagundo with about 65km done and still over half the day left. From here to the finish in San Felice it was all downhill! An Italian Specialties van was waiting at the top to greet me and I took it as a sign that I would have a great day ahead.
The descent went so fast and smooth that I didn’t have much time to think about my legs before the long and steady climb up to the finish at the top of the mountain. The climb was steep and quite a few people were turning around but I didn’t have much choice, I was close and was determined to finish this route. I’m glad I persevered because I was rewarded with an incredible view at the top and of course a nice Italian feast with great beer and wine. The other riders seemed to have great days too and the whole village came out to celebrate the great summer day and ride. It was the perfect way to end the season and another great experience racing in Italy.
When I told people I was racing an “Italian Specialities” race for one of my final races of the season I didn’t get much of a response. But when I explained that I was racing a 1750m ascent mountain race for about 100km with over 1750m of elevation gain on narrow, cobblestoned roads in the middle of the Alps, they all understood and were impressed. I was excited about it too. I felt great the two weeks in Italy and had another five days before I needed to start packing up and head home. It was going to be a hot day and I planned on racing smart and conserving as much energy as possible, as I always do.
The course began and ended at the village of Montegrino which was about 30 minutes from my apartment in Mendrisio. When I arrived I noticed that there were a lot of people out running and biking and the bike park was busy too. It didn’t seem very sleepy to me so I decided to bike down to check it out. It was quite a busy little town but there was also some money to be made with the number of people coming through. A great restaurant, several bike shops, a hostel, and some hotels meant that the town was popular enough for most people to get by and then there were other more remote things to attract tourists like the grotto with a small waterfall and several hiking trails. The area seemed to be pretty good to me.
On the way back I found the start line about a kilometer before I got to town. The flag was already up and the finish line was taped out in the village square. At 9AM we were supposed to be at the start line which was up the road a bit. It was just after 8AM so I headed over for the flag raising ceremony which was a bit more formal than I was used to. There were a few speeches and the club president (who didn’t speak English) spoke for a bit too. He was introduced by the commissaire who spoke perfect English. Then he asked me to say a few words. He started a bit too fast so I followed his pace and repeated “It was a pleasure to come and race here” a few times.

Interview with Director Richard Sala
Filmmaker Richard Sala’s a comic book and graphic novel artist with a style that’s instantly recognizable — a mash-up of B-movies, spy movies and Golden Age comics.
He is the creator of the characters Dracula Diaries and The Creeps, but when it comes to the story of Banshee, Banshee’s mostly taking direction from Sala.
Banshee just premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival, but Sala didn’t want to just show the film as he had made it. He wanted to update it for the festival.
“We’re trying to be creative with the technologies we have now, like adding some cool animation. That’s something I’ve never done before, and we’re learning as we go.”
Sala’s editing the footage and providing sound effects, the actress is in Chicago filming episodes of a web series.
“One of the things that excites me about web series is that I can use talented friends to do the voices,” Sala said. “We’re going to add some sound effects.”
And that’s how you know the director of a gourmet squirrel film has good taste. The movie will be the same.
“We’re aiming for a PG-13 rating,” he said. “We’re going to use the occasional curse word. But then we’re not going to overdo it. There’s an arc to the story, a progression and that we’ll maintain throughout.”
Banshee is a mystery thriller about a young photographer’s obsession with a porn star that ends in a car accident.
“In classic B-movie form, the obsession begins when he meets this girl who gets his attention, the girl of his dreams,” Sala said. “There’s a parallel story to that of a gourmet chef. There are all kinds of oddities, strange things happening around him.
“At the end of the movie, the porn star is in this bad car accident, and that’s the last time he sees her. In the beginning he was obsessed with this girl, and at the end it turns into obsession with a body, which leads to the gourmet chef angle.”
Banshee also has a food blogger angle, with the gourmet chef (played by Sara Cann) writing about his cooking in a blog that’s pretty much what you’d expect from a food blog, lots of text, not a lot of images.
“It’s so non-digital that it comes across as more authentic,” he said. “It’s funny because now you’re starting to see these Gwyneth Paltrows, who write about healthy recipes and the pictures are all just plastic food. We’re doing the exact opposite with it. There are no pictures and it’s more verbose.”
The flick is about food, but Sala didn’t want to make it just a food movie.
“We were shooting and we would be talking about the food, so it kind of led itself to be a food movie,” Sala said. “But I wanted to do something more. I didn’t want to make a typical food movie. So what I did was use the food in an anthropomorphic sense.”
There’s a funny food fight scene, where the gourmet chef beats a slob by using his food in a martial art he invents called Cuisine.
“We had some fun with that because we do a lot of fighting,” he said. “One of the actors is a martial artist, and I’ve trained him in a couple of fights, and I do some other martial arts stuff.”
The final food fight between Banshee and the gourmet chef is a pretty epic battle.
Sala made several short films before moving on to bigger and more complicated projects.
“I’ve made like a dozen short films that are basically a collection of my visual ideas that I had. Some of them I don’t like too much, but I like the others. I consider those practice films,” he said.
But the short films were always met with the question, when are you going to make a feature?
“When I would go into festivals with those films, people would say, ‘When are you going to make a feature?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I know. I’m working on it.'”
Sala’s probably the most well-known graphic novel artist in Chicago, and he’s known

2024-09-25 03:24:48,467 - Prompt 30: The old librarian discovered a forgotten letter between
2024-09-25 03:24:48,467 - Generated text:  the pages of his old book. A letter written to him in 1945. His friendship with the author of the letter was the subject of many conversations. But he didn’t want to share those letters to his readers. So he stored them away, for no one to find, not until now. These letters will tell the tale of their friendship, and how they both coped with war and its aftermath.
Joe left his business card at the 7-Eleven where we met. I don’t know if I mentioned it before, but his hair is really black. It’s jet black. The same color as his eyes, which makes him look quite intimidating. It’s an odd color for him. Usually he doesn’t really look that threatening. Except when he’s working on his motorcycle, but that’s another story. He’s also very much a loner, which is why we haven’t seen each other in months. I don’t know what it is that we have in common, but we always seemed to make an effort to talk when we met. I was a little surprised to see him there, but I was pretty happy, too.
I didn’t see him when he came back into the office, and I’m not really sure where he was sitting when he finally entered. I have no idea if he was listening to our conversation, but I knew he was nearby, because I always seem to know when he’s listening. He’s a really sharp guy, as I’ve mentioned before. I don’t think he’s looking for a girlfriend, but he does have a lot of female friends. I don’t really know any of them, so I guess I could say that he’s very good at having women as friends. But I don’t think he’s really looking for a girlfriend. He’s really interested in music and philosophy, but I’m not really sure what it is about me that attracts him.
The librarian was the only one who really knew what the letters were about. Joe had never really been one to share too many of his personal thoughts, but he did tell me that the old librarian was a true friend. And I think that’s what Joe liked about him. There were certain topics that Joe knew about that were too personal to discuss with most people. But the old librarian was a trusted friend. And Joe loved the old librarian.
It is possible that Joe could be jealous of the old librarian, but I think he might have been more jealous of his own sister. Because even though he was a very private person, I think he might have been more concerned about his own relationship with his sister than with the old librarian.
The old librarian was a very private person. So Joe’s feelings were definitely more complex. But the thing is, Joe loved the old librarian. The old librarian was the closest thing to his mom he had ever known. So I think that is what made Joe so protective of him. And when Joe left his job as a librarian to become a bike rider, it was probably because he was afraid he was going to hurt his best friend.
I think Joe loved the old librarian. I think he was afraid that he was going to hurt his best friend.
It’s a nice thing to have a best friend like that, and Joe seemed to be a good one. But I think that Joe’s best friend was probably Joe’s sister, and that was the reason why he left his job as a librarian. I think that the old librarian was Joe’s sister, and that was why he left his job as a librarian.
Theres no one else to blame. I think Joe probably didn’t like the old librarian very much. I think Joe didn’t like the old librarian very much because the old librarian was Joe’s sister.
Theres no one else to blame. I think Joe probably didnt like the old librarian very much. I think Joe probably didnt like the old librarian very much because the old librarian was Joe sister.
This is something I dont think is common in romance stories, but the old librarian is Joe’s sister. And Im pretty sure that was a factor in why Joe left his job as a librarian. If Joe had never met the old librarian, I think he probably would have stayed on as a librarian. But since Joe met the old librarian, Im pretty sure he knew that he wasnt going to like him.

"Pray, let me out, ma'am! the house-dog is behind the lodge, and it's just ready to do its worst!"

"Go and open the gate directly, Rosalie; and, for God's sake, lock it instantly after me, for the fellow might jump over it, or find some other way to get in."

"Will not you let me see who it is, ma'am?"

"You may, and you may not. I will not receive a visitor in the kitchen."

"But who is it?"

"You are a fool, Rosalie. You know very well that it is some one in whom I am very much interested."

"Mr. Stanley, perhaps?"

"Why do you ask?"

"Because, I can guess, ma'am."

"What are you afraid of?"

"Oh, nothing. I am glad enough to see him once in a way. But he comes so very seldom, that I don't know what you have to talk to him about."

The door opened, and the footsteps were heard of the friend who came to inquire after the poor old lady whom he loved and venerated like a mother.

Catherine sat up from her work, and went to the door to meet him, and received a kiss, which was as warm from the affectionate heart as it was salutary from the pure lips of her friend. She led him up to her, and they sat down side by side, the kindness of Stanley's heart winning the confidence of his companion.

"My dear Catherine," he said, as soon as she had fixed herself comfortably on her sofa, "I have something of importance to say to you."

She turned to him a mild and earnest countenance, reflecting the character of her gentle heart; while her manner and speech expressed at once perfect confidence and perfect humility.

"It is very kind of you, my dear Mr. Stanley, to tell me that you have something of importance to say to me. I shall be glad to listen to you with as much attention as I can command, for it is not often that I have the happiness of seeing you, and I am truly thankful that you have thought me worthy of a friendly visit."

"It is not altogether a visit of friendship," replied the other, "though it is a visit of sincere affection. Do you remember the evening when you were sitting alone in your little parlour, with that light in the window that has forsaken you--I mean the firelight, not the lamp--and I saw you talking with that little girl of mine, who was so troubled with her aunt's death, and who seemed at that moment very far from having so bright a future before her?"

"Do you not remember how much we thought that very morning of her future?--and I trust, she will forget it."

"She has a friend who has promised to care for her when her aunt is dead," replied Stanley; "and I am now come to tell you that he will keep his word."

"Ah, Mr. Stanley," said Catherine, rising in some confusion, "I feel that you flatter me; but, indeed, it is not so. I have had no power in this matter. It was the desire of your own heart, and it is not I who should promise, or who can promise, that the young lady who is dear to you shall be well provided for in the future. If any one can do that, it must be some one of a higher station than myself, and it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that any one of higher station will take her in hand."

"If it is reasonable, Catherine," replied Stanley, gravely, "there will not be much real pity for her; if it is unreasonable, you will have that satisfaction."

"Why, what does it mean, Mr. Stanley?" she asked, looking up with a very earnest and inquiring eye. "Tell me what you mean."

"That is easily said," he replied. "I mean, that there are many persons who would be disposed to help her, if they only knew that she was in distress. You know I never was a mushroom in these matters. I never would tell you of any intentions I had until I could tell you that they had been fulfilled; but I have a reason for being afraid to

First one: a tiny bulbous, bulging, tentacle-heavy, hairless, greasy, grotesque ooze that is born inside a single adult host creature: “PornGuts.” The second: a little walking vagina, with three extra sets of testicles dangling under her armpits.
Fortunately, PornGuts can speak english, and also reminds her human host creature of that she (or it?) is pregnant, and that she will give birth at any moment. PornGuts is eager to become the mother of the entire human race, but her host creature isn’t very eager to give birth at all, and soon a war between the two organisms begins.
Meanwhile, PornGuts is watched over by a race of little humanoid dwarfs who try to help PornGuts’ host creature give birth without damaging herself. But her womb is inside PornGuts, which has a face, and two big gaping eyeballs, so watching over her (or it?) is impossible.
“Snotguts”, a sentient mass of hanging phlegm, is also there, but he is not as interested in “helping” as he is in being there.
Meanwhile, back on Earth, human scientists use PornGuts’ data to learn to communicate with PornGuts and to figure out what she is trying to tell them. This data is gathered, so to speak, by humans, who travel to the far reaches of space in their space suit robot ships, to collect this data.
The president of Earth, an incredibly beautiful woman in her twenties, begins to monitor all communications back and forth between the scientists and the space suit robots, because she believes that something must be wrong, because she’s not getting enough emails, or Instagram pics from her fans.
All the while, the space suit robots have no idea that “president” is a type of person, or what Instagram is. In their heads, there’s no such thing as Instagram, or “president”, or “knife” or “penis” or “human” or “face” or “breast” or anything like that.
Instead, the space suit robots keep track of each other’s activities using a digital clock. Each of the spacesuit robots uses a digital clock as a reference point for how “busy” they are. The person who’s on the phone more, or talking more, gets an added quarter minute to his or her digital clock, and is shown to be the busiest and most popular.
A popular one, if you can believe it.
The more the popularity of the person on the phone increases, the more business they’re doing, and the more time they have on their digital clock. So the scientists do business, the more they are on the phone with each other, the busier they are. And if a scientist is very busy, he’s popular, and popular people get more business.
The president of Earth wants everyone to be popular, so she puts the space suit robots in charge of monitoring their digital clocks.
Meanwhile, PornGuts and the scientists are trying to come up with a solution to make PornGuts happy, and give birth to the human race, but there’s always a catch: she (or it?) doesn’t want to give birth at all. She’d rather just hang out in her host creature’s belly.
But the scientists don’t have the time to come up with a solution, because they’re all busy with their own digital clocks, which are also connected to their business, and their popularity. They are popular because they have the most business, which they have because they’re always busy, because they’re popular. And the president is always busy, and never popular.
In the end, PornGuts ends up killing herself, because she (or it?) doesn’t want to die, but can’t figure out how to give birth.
So the human race goes extinct.
This film would be a bit slow, and the science part of it would be quite boring. It would be very well made, and the sets would look amazing. There would be some kind of digital clock, and the president would probably wear a cape.
For the dialogue, the president would probably say something like, “I don’t like the way this story is going.”
The movie would probably be about a woman who is about to die, and wants to get a divorce from her husband. She would then kill herself.
My first impression was that it was

2024-09-25 03:24:48,468 - Generated text:  in the resort village,
Just a hundred yards from the shore, where once sailed sloop and dinghy,
But where now there's no one to feel the oar,
Or sense the lilt of the lake, beneath the old willow tree.
Of the unpredictable sea, that beats on the steely shore,
Where the freckled fish leap from beneath the breakers and bounce,
And where once the crab pots were filled with seafood galore.
But there's nothing left now that once used to be there,
The rocks are all rusty, the dunes are bleached and bare.
Just a hundred yards from the shore
But where now there's no one to feel the pull,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
For where once the dogfish chased the eels beneath the sand,
The men who came here caught their catch for their work and their dinners,
And the women who came here gathered their laundry and rugs,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
Now that old steel and the rust have been stolen,
By whoever chose that the benefits to them outweighed the costs,
Now that it's done and the wheels have turned in their heads,
Will they see that it's no use now to say: "Don't bother!"
There's nothing left now that once used to be there,
But where now there's no one to feel the pull,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
Now the conquests have started of a second world,
And these forces are spent with just a hard few miles,
Where the engineers, impatient to take from the land,
Being bought to the cause are only too willing to die.
But it's not like that to them, when they hear of a war,
And though they may hear of the siege at the old port or hill,
For they don't think of the little things that don't stand a chance,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
For this is the kind of life they know.
Where the old man does not walk in the evening light,
And the fish that once basked and the lilies do not bloom,
And the villages and their owners all left together in the night.
But there's nothing left now that once used to be there,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
Of the forsaken harbour, that once set in gold,
The old life is gone, and it's hard to have a heart.
And that life, though so precious, was never a hardship,
For it's nature's way and we must learn to endure it.
There's nothing left now that once used to be there,
But where now there's no one to feel the pull,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
Rising early in the dawn of the day,
With a cup of black coffee in my hand,
Away from the reef I did not mind going,
But my back felt so bad from the years of old,
I looked at the sea, and I knew that I must see,
If there's anything still left of that village there,
As I went to the end of the jetty where the air is pure.
And what I saw was enough to make me wonder,
What's going on in the world these days?
To see a place so loved in the evening sun,
Turned grey and dirty now that there's no one there,
With no life left now that used to be there.
But there's nothing left now that once used to be there,
Just a hundred yards from the shore,
But where now there's no one to feel the pull,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
The Drywell
We saw the dead of the night die in the dry well,
When the black rain did come and the sea was brown,
There was fire, and there was flood, but there was no help,
The houses were all dark, and the houses were gone,
And not one day after, for years and years,
I saw the graves that they placed out in the street,
Where once the children laughed, the old men wept.
The strange wind did blow when the dark sky hung low,
But there's nothing left now that once used to be there,
But where now there's no one to feel the pull,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.
Just a hundred yards from the shore,
But where now there's no one to feel the pull,
Just a hundred yards from the shore.

Siren songs and whispers of enchantment, deceit, love and desperation are all the topics of a new book written by a local author.

The story came about as a result of that research.
The story is about a man incarcerated for mental illness.
Harris said that she wrote this book because she wanted people to read it and to learn about the Cherokee Indians.
As an owner of a restaurant, Harris said that her stories of fictional restaurants are not just a way to write about food and drinks. She also incorporates lifestyles, living situations and other things she knows about to make them realistic.
“There’s been people that say that they feel like they’re there,” she said.
Harris hopes that the story would capture the interest of readers of all ages. She also hopes to write a second book in the future.
“Whispering Secrets of the Forest” is available at Finishing Touch Bookstore at 158 Commerce St. in Hendersonville.

Since the events occurred in Birdsong, Georgia and Hawkinsville, Georgia, where the author of this story now lives, she wanted to make sure that the information given in the book is true and accurate. She interviewed many descendants of Hawkinsville, Georgia, which is an unincorporated village in Pulaski County, Georgia, United States. The town was founded in 1835 when a new town was laid out by Gen. Joseph Hawkins and his brother Jesse Hawkins. The town was platted to accommodate the county’s seat of government and was named in honor of the founder. In the year of 1968, the town became a village and is the county seat of Pulaski County. It was later designated a National Historic Landmark. She also used the web to do further research on the name, “Indian Tongue.” It is thought to be so because it is bordered by two Indian Rivers – the Withlacooche

I’m one of the millions who followed my dreams to an unknown place, a new country, and found myself in a different world, a new reality, and eventually a new home.
That decision to wake up in a foreign land led me to fall in love with a Colombian, get married, and establish a home here in Colombia, South America. It also brought me to a decision that would eventually lead to the birth of a new company, Previo.
I left the island paradise that was Puerto Rico in 1994. I spent a year working as a bartender at a hotel and realized that I didn’t want to pursue a career as a professional bartender. Not because I didn’t love it, I was passionate about it. I just didn’t see it as my future. After months of thinking about how to turn my passion into a future career, I decided to move to New York City to study psychology and continue bartending.
I bartended in a NYC restaurant during the day and attended classes at night. I found a roommate on Craiglist and we moved into an apartment in the East Village. After two semesters, I decided that it was not for me. Psychology was a subject of interest, but I felt that I wasn’t ready to study in a classroom and spend my days in a library. My focus at the time was more practical and it involved bartending and restaurants. I moved to Miami to continue studying hospitality management. I completed my degree in Florida and moved back to New York to pursue a job as a bartender.
It was while I was in New York City that I began a journey to uncover my true self. A journey that continues today. I started to read spiritual texts and to think more deeply about the world around me and my relationship with others. I believed in God and that there was a Supreme Being that was looking out for me. I meditated, walked, studied, and experimented.
In 2005, I moved to Colombia, South America to teach English and pursue a career in bartending. At the time, I wasn’t sure what the future held for me. I had met a girl online, and decided to meet her in person. Her name was Jeannie and she was from Cali. She was a musician and I had just landed my first teaching job in Colombia. I had also had my first bartending experience and I was starting to realize that bartending was what I wanted to do as a career. I had tried teaching before and I thought it wasn’t for me. I stayed for four years and established myself as a bartender and cocktail professional, traveling throughout Colombia, the Caribbean, and Central America as a bar manager and consultant. I also fell in love with Jeannie, my now Colombian wife.
I moved to Miami to pursue my dream of bartending as a career. I had several different jobs as a bar manager and consultant before I decided that I wanted to do something different. I was inspired by one of my friends from Colombia, Javier Soto, who had launched an e-commerce store and was successfully selling handmade Colombian products. I wanted to launch my own business. I wanted to do something that would allow me to travel the world and share my love of cocktails. I wanted to create an opportunity that would allow me to write about the people and places I visited.
I traveled to Ireland and discovered the world of Irish whiskey and realized that there was a gap in the industry. There was a need for a brand of whiskey for people who were just beginning to explore this category. I had a deep passion for whiskey and I was excited about the opportunity to launch my own brand.
I had been creating travel content for years and thought about combining my love of whiskey and travel. I launched Previo to create a global whiskey experience, creating events and festivals that would allow me to share my passion with the world. Previo is a global lifestyle brand that offers the opportunity to travel to explore the world’s top whiskey destinations. We offer exclusive access to the best whiskey events and celebrations in the world. We create unique experiences that bring our global community together to share in the magic of whiskey, food, culture, music, and adventure. We connect people, places, and stories through our annual festivals and events.
I am incredibly proud of what we have built at Previo. It is a community of whiskey and travel enthusiasts that span the globe. Our events and festivals have allowed us to connect people from all over the world and to share in the culture, history, and passion of our guests.

But when his first creation resurfaces in the form of a confused 7-year-old boy, it sets off a chain of events that will have incredible consequences for a world that never knew of its existence.
Once upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away... there lived a galaxy filled with all sorts of Star Wars characters - from Luke Skywalker to Princess Leia and even Darth Vader. Unfortunately, this galaxy was made up of mostly three-dimensional puppets, and while the special effects were great, the end result was less than stellar. Still, Disney felt that this galaxy was pretty much perfect, and so they're releasing a whole new series of "live action" films that are based on these puppets.

My favourite Japanese drama. It is quite difficult to explain the plot. Basically, everybody who goes to the same school, live in the same neighbourhood (the same housing estate), go to the same cram school are following their own dreams with the help of a tutor.
If you want to know more about this drama, you can find the Japanese drama review in the NTV official site.
Hachirota is the hero, and it is just amazing how a person with so little self-esteem could be such a good hero. He is the quiet one, but always behind to solve problems. And through the drama he becomes a better person, overcoming his weakness and try to fulfill his promise with Aki (and the promise he made with Kuni), finally being able to take care of himself.
The best scene in the whole drama is in episode 17, the one where Hachirota is supposed to play a role on stage, and he almost gives up (but remember that the main characteristic of this drama is not the romance between Hachirota and Kuni, but rather the comedy and comedy plot in the whole drama).
The love between Hachirota and Aki is in some episodes a little unrealistic, but you know that you must understand this for the sake of the comedy plot, it is a drama comedy, after all. Anyway, I think that Hachirota and Aki make a perfect couple.
And another good thing is the fact that this drama is realistic. I believe in the theory that we have only one life, and that everything that you want to do in life you must do in this life. So this drama shows you that life can be full of wonder, if you give your best. It doesn't matter if your dreams are small or big, you can make them happen if you fight for them, and I believe that this drama is meant to show us that if we dream and we fight for our dreams we can make them come true.
I love the soundtrack. It is just wonderful, and in the end, when the DVD was released, there were some words about it (and it is written that T.M.Revolution was chosen for the soundtrack because he is a fan of the series).
I have never seen a comedy-drama, or a drama-comedy, but this is very good. Hachirota and Aki are quite cute (and I am almost tempted to say that they are the best couple ever), but the most important is that this is a good and very interesting drama.
Toda Erika is a good actress, and Tsujimoto Takashi is the funniest actor in Japan right now.
By Katsuko Ohta
A short drama (15 episodes) that warns of the nightmarish consequences of reality TV shows. While everyone in a small town shares the same dream and hopes for its fulfillment, that dream is broadcast in real time and for all to see.
It's a story of a hero who faces up to what he wants to do. Hachirota starts out without self-esteem, unable to even be seen by his classmates, but through dreaming of being the hero that he secretly admires, he faces up to the possibility that he may become a hero too.
The acting is very good. It's funny, though the story is serious and, at times, sad.
One of the good points is that each episode ends in a very good and/or funny way.
Highly recommended. One of the best shows I have ever seen.

Perfect! Why? Well because it's not only one of the best Japanese series I've seen so far, it's also one of the best Japanese series ever! Hontou ni ai suru koto o shinjiteitteitai no yo!
What I like about the story of this drama is how it's connected to all the previous episodes...in other words, every episode has a connection to the next, and it's all based on dreams. The drama starts off a little slow, but by the 2nd episode you will get hooked with what's going on with the characters. There's also lots of funny parts and cute romance going on! The ending is sad but still leaves hope for what's going to happen. (I guess that's why the drama is called "BUT, sometimes...", because you know, when people's dreams don't

The Indianapolis Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) is making history, hosting the quietest concert, and even created an IndieGoGo campaign to share this experience with others around the world. A six-time Grammy Award winning composer named Ben Johnston wrote the Quiet Music for an audience of 150, the IPO’s smallest ever.
It’s not about being in sync with the music but with the harmony around you.
People of all ages and backgrounds are able to enjoy the symphony in their own way; some people cry because they feel so deeply connected to the notes.
Marc Viggiano, an artistic director of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, said it’s important to bring the symphony to the people because classical music is not well-known in his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana.
“There is nothing like hearing the orchestra performing. It’s an absolute joy,” Viggiano said.
This is also the first time the IPO collaborated with Dafne Schippers, a fashion designer who handcrafted a unique outfit for each musician.
“It felt so refreshing to work with musicians, instead of runway models,” said Schippers.
Normally, orchestras wear the same uniforms for thousands of years, and this project allows the musicians to show their personality.
Their instruments can speak more loudly than words. It’s a symphony of sounds.
“I have long believed that classical music has the power to enrich all of our lives,” Viggiano said.
He thinks that everyone can benefit from listening to classical music because it opens people up to love and connect with themselves and others.
“It’s a sense of well-being,” said Viggiano.
Music can also change the mindsets of people. It gives them hope to move forward.
Viggiano’s biggest wish is to make classical music more accessible to people and bring more joy into their lives.
“I do not want the music to be forever elusive,” he said.
Sarah Elmquist, a professional trumpet player from Sweden, didn’t have much experience with classical music, but she enjoyed listening to classical music in order to relax and fall asleep.
“My first impression of the concert was that it is quite beautiful and incredibly fascinating to see and experience, and it was fun to try to understand what was going on,” said Elmquist.
She came to Indianapolis to record Ben Johnston’s Quiet Music, and it was a new experience for her.
“The composer was happy with how it turned out. That was very rewarding for me,” she said.
She plays in different orchestras and conducts in order to earn a living, and she sees music as a language that everyone can understand and use in their daily life.
“Music is everywhere. You don’t need to go to a symphony concert to enjoy music. Just listen, and you will see,” Elmquist said.

Thank you for your kind feedback, Alida!
I am so grateful for this article and the beautiful photography and presentation of the experience. We do not live near any major orchestra and it has been so long since I have gone to a live performance. The project you have portrayed here is so accessible and it was so inviting. Thank you.

She offered her hand. He clasped it. When he withdrew his hand, he held her palm between his warm, rough-skinned thumb and forefinger. He kept his eyes on hers as she held his hand. He was big. She couldn’t help but shiver.
“I won’t let you go.”
That’s what she was telling herself too.
Taking the elevator with him made her nervous. She took small steps, keeping close to him. She couldn’t seem to look away from his eyes.
The door dinged to a stop on the fifth floor. He took her elbow and led her down a long hallway. His shirt was rumpled, and he stole another kiss before releasing her.
Was she imagining it? The wink she saw? Or was it just another effect of having a drink?
“You sure you’re okay to drive?”
Dinner and dancing were fine. They’d walked to their cars with a shared kiss. He opened her door, leaned in, and kissed her again.
“Don’t text me,” he’d said.
But what was a girl to do?
Beckett would say, ‘Careful.’ Noah would ask if he could drive her home. She answered yes.
Her ride pulled in at the curb in front of her car. She waited for him to park and come around.
He didn’t come.
She saw the cockiness in his eyes. Didn’t he know that driving while intoxicated was against the law? If they’d both driven, it was a separate crime for both of them. Wasn’t it?
He climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine. He backed out slowly, driving across the parking lot.
“I’m fine,” she called out the window.
She was sure she could keep an eye on him.
But what if he lost control of the car?
She was reminded of a horrific scene of the night before. A young man had jumped the curb and collided with another car, then flipped end over end, landing upside down in the gutter. One of his eyes was blue.
She’d thought of calling an ambulance, but one of the men driving by told her the man was dead.
During the week, she’d been plowed into by a drunk driver on the way home from a funeral. That time, she’d felt it in every bone.
Now she felt an ache in her chest.
How bad was this?
Her fingers plucked at her car keys. Her forehead was slick with sweat.
There was the possibility of an accident. Or being late. He’d been waiting nearly half an hour. He’d been waiting so long, he hadn’t wanted to stay at the restaurant. Now she wasn’t ready to go, and she didn’t know how to tell him.
She looked for the day’s parking receipt in her purse, then let her hand drop.
Sundays were the worst. Sundays were the best.
A slow trickle of awareness crawled up her spine.
It was always Sunday.
Whatever she was feeling, it was already happening.

Writer/director Cameron Crow has built his filmography on quirky characters and flawed heroes, whether they are in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Say Anything (1989), and Almost Famous (2000), and this latest film offers more of the same. This time Crow's protagonist is a dog named Barkley (voiced by Michael Keaton). Barkley lives in an upscale Southern California neighborhood with his owner, Ted (Kirk Douglas), and thinks he is a superhero (like the comic book figure created by Ted's late son), except that he believes in order to be truly heroic he must be angry. One night Barkley realizes that the neighbor's house is on fire, and he alerts the fire department, who are able to save the house and its two occupants. Soon after, Barkley's owner succumbs to terminal cancer and Barkley gets dumped at a doggie daycare center. Just as Barkley is about to be put down, he is rescued by Louise (Nicole Kidman) and her daughter Carly (Jaime King). She is a down-on-her-luck former actress who is now a disgruntled attorney, and he is the family dog. Barkley soon discovers that Carly's father has been cheating on Louise and Barkley feels that this is an opportunity for him to be a superhero. Barkley returns home to his would-be protectors and discovers that another one of the neighborhood doggies has stolen Carly's and Louise's identities and is using it for his own purposes. So Barkley decides to use his anger to right the wrong, setting out to find his way back to his family. The result is the fourth film adaptation of Barkley's comic book, created by Ted when he was in college. Critic Jan DeKnock, in her review for the Chicago Tribune, felt that "It's one of those special kiddie pictures, easy to take and rather pleasant to digest" and called the film "a triumph of good intentions and simple production values." ~ Andrea LeVasseur, Rovi

Critic Reviews for Beowulf
Cameron Crow's latest movie Beowulf is a movie about a superhero dog that inadvertently becomes a superhero.
A so-so comedy.
It makes good use of Keaton's hyperanimated vocals and contains some fleeting amusement, but most of the time it falls flat.
Film succeeds by pretending to be a low-budget indie.
There are plenty of good-looking, middle-class places to live in America, but there are few as secure and upscale as the one glimpsed in this jolly little film.
This flick is simply one the whole family can enjoy and is worth seeing.
The dog is the only one who seems to know what's going on.
Only watch if you can't think of anything better to do.
Audience Reviews for Beowulf
Keaton's performance as Barkley is absolutely superb! With his clear understanding and portrayal of canine behaviour the character is delivered convincingly and successfully, this often goes unnoticed by crowds when the films are released, who seem to forget that the films are mostly about the animal characters. I absolutely adore this movie, it is one of the greatest dog movies ever. Beowulf works in every sense of the word, it was a critical and commercial success and was released in September 2007 which saw a great deal of marketing in Australia. This is the fourth adaptation of Beowulf's story and it is really impressive to see this take on the legend. Most people know of Beowulf, even if they have not read it, its title is renowned among mythological circles. The movie has fun dialogue, great plot and marvellous acting and it even has some comedic, social and satirical overtones. Its animation style, has some parts of it that are bre

For instance, you could browse through the list of songs that are in your music player by turning your head and moving your eyes. In a similar fashion, you could scroll through your photos by tilting your head, and Zoom in and out by moving your eyes. The user also has the ability to use the glasses as a smart camera with 360° videos, and a 3D head-up display.
Although this type of technology may sound futuristic and out of this world, these aren’t some screens or headphones—Flyt’s smart glasses are actually regular glasses. The product is currently on pre-order.
“There’s no replacement for natural movement and expression. Flyt puts the human body at the center of the interaction, so the user can control everything with head movements, eyes and gestures. We don’t force the user to learn complex gestures, codes, hardware buttons or hand-waving,” said Faraldo.

More and more companies are investing in artificial intelligence, which has led to the creation of Alexa-like home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo. Amazon is looking to expand its line with the Echo Show, a smart home device that has a screen and a camera, which users can use to make video calls.

A company by the name of Super Rare Games is about to release Super Rare Originals, a collection of 25 different indie games, including Metroidvania, survival games, and puzzle games.
Many of these games have already released their titles on Nintendo Switch, which makes this collection even more exciting for the Switch crowd.
Finally, a product that could help you recreate your morning routine.
Invention Studios took a look at how morning routines have become very technology-driven in the modern age. They’re developing a back-to-nature concept by giving people a way to “easily harness the sun’s energy” to charge a device while you’re at work.
The product is essentially a solar powered docking station with USB charging capabilities that uses the technology and materials of smartphones. This device could not only help keep your morning routine simple, it could also be a way to reduce the amount of technology you have at work.
These innovations are fun and interesting, but they aren’t the end-all-be-all. They won’t replace the need for more education in these fields or the use of students. The innovations of 2017—and the years to come—show that technology could become much more valuable, important, and necessary than it has been in the past.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,469 - Prompt 49: A mysterious artifact uncovered in Egypt revealed
2024-09-25 03:24:48,469 - Generated text:  the ancient Pyramids of Giza were originally intended to be eight-sided.
“When we get started with the pyramids we’re supposed to be interested in size alone, but that’s only the first part of the story. It’s been fascinating that people have recently become curious about the inner workings, inner structure and the symbolism of the Great Pyramid.”
The monumental three-sided Egyptian Pyramid was completed in 2,600 BC, but was built with an empty chamber. Three passages lead to the inner chamber and feature intertwining corridors that look like they’ve been deliberately constructed, and from this arises speculation about the religious importance of the Pyramids of Giza.
“It’s highly unusual to have empty space inside of a pyramid and we don’t have an explanation for why they left that space empty,” says Bob Brier, a Professor of Egyptology and Archaeology at Long Island University.
“So I can’t say that there was one particular reason for that, but I think in general we can say that the Egyptians had a completely different view of the world from us.
“What the Egyptians were interested in was this other world, this world of the Gods, so they would do things like have holes in the ground that lead down into the netherworld. They would put statues in the ground that they would fill with food and water and other things, so they could visit the spirit of the deity.”
The pyramids’ architects may have done this to ensure their success, for the dead pharaoh. They used geometry and mathematical principles to create impressive edifices that displayed advanced engineering skills. The three pyramids – the Great Pyramid, Khafre, and Menkaure – have the same size ratio but different base sizes, and it’s been suggested that the Giza pyramids were originally eight-sided.
“The truth is that the Giza pyramids were intended to be eight sided and this has to do with a really ancient idea, which is the number 8 was an important sacred number, just like the number 7,” says Brier.
“It’s been thought for a long time that this was because the lunar cycle was 29 1/3 days and if you multiply that by four you get 7 days. But it may have to do more with the idea that the base was eight sides, meaning it was larger than the Pyramid on the west bank. But because they had three sides that were horizontal, it was turned into a pyramid by using other pyramidal shapes.”
This fact has been known since the early 19th century but it remained a mystery for the 200 years since, until researchers had a look at the site with an entirely different approach.
“When we get started with the pyramids we’re supposed to be interested in size alone, but that’s only the first part of the story. It’s been fascinating that people have recently become curious about the inner workings, inner structure and the symbolism of the Great Pyramid,” Brier tells SciFi-Cable.
“The idea here is that by going inside and finding all these hidden chambers that are full of coffer holes and vent shafts and things like that, that it would allow us to know what the original intention was.”
According to Brier, there is now enough evidence to prove that the pyramids were never really intended as eight-sided structures, and that the mysterious five missing pyramids are likely to be buried beneath the surface.
“I think it’s a matter of having an open mind to explore what the evidence tells you, because the evidence says that the three pyramids that we see today were the three sides that were built, but that originally there were supposed to be eight pyramids,” he explains.
“This is no longer the smoking gun, this is the 90% proof, which is all that you can have in the archaeological world. In Egypt, we know that the pyramids of the Sun God (Ra) are to be found underneath the pyramid of the Moon God (Horus) and if we really want to find the other pyramids, all we have to do is look underneath, underground, to find the other pyramids.”

In order that this might not be a meaningless ritual, the members of the camp had already drawn lots, and the members of the "Star of David" had drawn the short straw: They had to bring the flint and tinder. But, since they were the youngest members of the camp, they were allowed to abide by the boys' custom, and were given permission to bring a stump of sulphur, which they set on the fire to bring the fire to a roar.
Half-light fell on the chief who, with the melancholy, shapeless air of a man who had been driven to and fro on the wide ocean, came forward to begin the speech. With slow, solemn movements he lifted a tuft of grass and set it on the campfire, sprinkled the fire with salt, blew a few times on the flame, then, without a word, took his place in the circle of the campers, who, by this time, were seated around the fire, waiting for the speech.
The melancholy look which hung on the face of the chief gave way to an air of deep distress; then came the moment when he would burst into tears. With an effort he regained control of himself. The speech became a monologue in which he related the events of the days since the sinking of the ship.
He related that he and a few survivors of the ship, to whom he had become a kind of leader, had finally managed to build a raft and set it on the high seas. Since they had only five lifebelts left, they had remained aboard the raft. He related how they had drifted for three days, trying in vain to signal the lifeboat which, on the third day, had left them far behind.
They had seen an island in the far distance, but soon they had realized that it was only a mirage, and their desperate eyes had grown dull.
Then, on the third day, they had seen a strange phenomenon: a large number of black birds flew overhead, and even though the members of the group had never seen birds other than white gulls, they knew at once that these were seagulls. The chief, overcome with fright, realized that their destiny would be a difficult one, and he saw in the seagulls the forerunners of a storm. But the seagulls disappeared, and the storm never came.
And so it went, the words moving quickly between speech and thought. Then, at the end, with new self-confidence, he launched into the speech that had been agreed upon in advance.
"How have we been behaving toward each other since we have been aboard the raft? Well, we have been guilty of many faults, and these have been our enemies. Each day we took a ritual bath, and, by some strange lack of attention, one morning we forgot. For days and days, until we ran out of food, we had no bread. At last we decided to divide the five loaves we had left among ourselves. This too is a matter for reproach, for we had forgotten how to share. We are well aware that in the eyes of the world we are the villains, but we have done the best we could, and we have done much."
He concluded, and each of the members of the group, as the speech came to a close, opened his eyes wide, as if in surprise. Some sat up straight, some leaned forward, all were awakened to life, and the strain of three days in the darkest night came to an end.
Suddenly, there was a sharp, crackling sound in the silence. There were a few shouts of alarm, and then the silence returned.
The silence lasted for several minutes. Some of the members of the group began to think they had been the victims of a practical joke.
Then they heard a new crackling sound, and several of the survivors began to stir, as if to awake from a pleasant dream. The others quickly arose and huddled around the chief, who again, in the soft, faint light of the starry sky, stood like a figure in a dream. His lips were moving, and then there came the sound of a sharp shout. Again, everything fell into confusion, and many men sank to the ground.
But still another cry came from the bushes, and, at last, the survivors drew nearer and saw a couple of people emerge from the bushes, and they recognized at once that these were the two members of the "Star

Fabia could not tear her eyes away. The scene was no artifice of the easel, but the real life of a woman.
She felt her heart drop into her gut. It could be her own story. Not a creation of art but the truth of love.
The canvas continued to dance, the woman moving across the space. Fabia understood the miracle of the stroke and could only smile.
A hand reached across the canvas and grasped that of the woman, her body disappearing into a shroud of color.
A sob escaped Fabia. That’s when she felt it. The same hand grasped hers and that’s when the real magic happened. She was standing before a real human being, and a live performance at that.
The lightness of touch seeped into Fabia’s soul, her heart and her mind. It was time.
An artful transformation. From hated opponent to lover. From a nightmare of legal slavery to a hope-filled journey.
The pendulum of destiny had begun to swing. The lovers embraced, draped in joy. A swirl of color.
Fabia left the studio in a trance, smiling, the same way the artists were smiling.
The lead artist returned the glowing smile.
“That’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,” she said.

Within the shrine, a tiny Buddha smiles beatifically, his copper lips bearing the pink mark of his status as a child monk. He stands at the head of the hall, centerpiece of a yellow lacquer screen hanging on the altar.
At the side of the screen, against the wall of the hall, a stairway leading downward to a secret basement shrine is hidden. A young woman slowly makes her way to the stairway. No one else notices, so intent are they on their own prayers. She ducks quickly beneath the screen, and her face dissolves into a wraith.
With a flash of mist, she crosses through the stairs to the basement shrine, the Buddha following her, smiling. The young woman gives a bow before the altar and then turns around, smiling as she begins to fade.
A collective gasp sounds in the hall. The Buddha, turning, follows her out. The hall is empty but for a few flickering candles. The hall goes black.
He had never thought to spend a moment alone, in any country, with a god. It was one of those moments he knew could change the direction of his life. The chance was too good to pass up. As a scientist, there were places in the world he still wanted to see, people he wanted to meet.
So he left behind his career as an agent of U.N.O.K.K.A., the worldwide organization dedicated to containing supernatural threats. He traveled incognito, seeing more of the world, learning more about the old, old deities that people believed in.
It was the old gods he had become obsessed with, the gods that had vanished as if they had never been in the first place. Were they still out there, beyond mankind's ken, hiding or somewhere else?
Were they still with us?
Worried over her day, Misaki took a taxi to her apartment, where she had left a package of ten yen coins on her desk. The thought of doing a bit of coin-flipping brought her up a notch from the slight low she had felt all day.
She stripped down to her underwear and climbed into bed, the gentle hum of air conditioning soothing her to sleep.
The first of her dreams had her walking with a handful of yen coins in her hand, the metal glinting in the sunlight. Sweat trickled down her spine as her gaze took in the bright blue sky, the world all around her. Her stomach churned.
"Are you there, Lord?" Misaki asked.
As if his sudden appearance had been prearranged, he made his presence known. In an instant, the morning sunshine melted into darkness and Misaki sat up, hearing the sound of something scurrying across the ceiling. Her arms went out instinctively to break her fall.
"Misaki?" Toshi called from the hallway.
"I'm fine," she yelled, starting to slide down the bed.
A shrill screech pierced the silence, followed by a wet snuffling noise as something started to scratch at the door.
"G-god?" Misaki blurted. "It's me, Misaki. I'm still awake."
After a few moments, a shadow moved through the sliding glass door. The thrum of the rain beat a cadence in time with Misaki's heart, a faint echo of the soft wind that brushed her face as she settled back on the bed.
"Sorry for interrupting," the dark shape said, stepping closer and reaching into a pocket. His face appeared, his lips barely forming words, and Misaki stared at the tiny Buddha in his hands.
"I do not think I should be here," Misaki said, a fevered excitement in her voice. "My life is so mundane nowadays."
"I came to give you a coin," the Buddha said, his eyes moving to the floor.
"No, please don't," she said. "I don't think that would be appropriate."
The Buddha stared at the ground, a frown etched into his face. "It is not a coin, I am afraid. It is a promise." He stared up at her, his pink lips open and closed again.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,470 - Generated text:  humankind's quest for intelligence: it was the AI ​​computer and it was to mark the beginning of a series of systems for the processing of information that would revolutionize society. In a definitive sense, so for most scientists, this is how the story of artificial intelligence started. Others, however, consider it began long before the second half of the 20th century.
Artificial Intelligence: Humankind's Quest for Intelligence
The quest for humankind's quest for intelligence is ancient, so long that it's not even clear when it began. However, one of the first really documented attempts to produce artificial intelligence, in the sense that we use the term, was made by a 16-year-old Swiss watchmaker named Lukas Machina, in 1494, to try to improve the path of astronomical calculations. It was a time when the progress made in terms of mathematical knowledge of the laws of motion seemed to have reached an impasse, and Machina's attempt to use the first mechanical computing device to solve problems in astronomy was met with much skepticism. At that time it was generally believed that human intelligence was too complex to be simulated by the machinery.
Even Leonardo Da Vinci used to speak, ironically, of a way to reproduce a machine capable of thinking, much as in a circle of a circle:
“There is a machine similar to the circuit of a wheel, which will reproduce in one motion all the motions of this wheel, that is, all its revolutions; but this will not be done with animal forces, but with the force of water, and in the form of a circle. (The Universal Machine, Pietro Emanuel Borghi, p. 140)”
In 1945 the scientist Von Neumann published a series of works, 'The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory' and 'Theory of Self Reproducing Automata', on the artificial organism, the machine that can replicate itself, allowing the same to produce identical copies.
I am not a robot (I'm a machine)
Artificial Intelligence and Cyborgs
The next major step toward the birth of artificial intelligence can be considered to have been taken with the creation of the electronic computer. In fact, in 1938, two decades before von Neumann's writings, the first machine to perform the logic operations that constitute the basic function of the computer, and so also of artificial intelligence, came into being. We are talking about a fully electrical computer that has its own memory. It's the German machine called Z3.
This computer was developed by the engineer Konrad Zuse, in his apartment, with the intention of being a good tool for engineers. At that time it was not even called computer, and was described as a calculating machine, but Zuse's creation had in fact made its first attempts to perform logical operations on Boolean logic, that is, the logic that distinguishes between 'true' and 'false', and between '0' and '1'. These two operations then constitute the basic elements of the representation of information by the computer. In other words, Zuse's machine is a very old, rather simple electronic computer.
The work of Turing and other influential scientists led to the birth of a very high-powered computing machine, which was then developed by Alan Turing and other British scientists. The machine could perform all the operations needed for calculating, for the processing of information, and also began to be able to simulate a certain amount of human intelligence. All this happened in the period immediately following the Second World War, and led to the first simulated Artificial Intelligence. In fact, all the scientists who were working in the field of AI were focused on building a very simple computer that could reproduce human intelligence, an unattainable goal, as we can see.
In this sense, we are in the midst of the first phase of the search for artificial intelligence: at that time it is not the goal to achieve intelligence, or to find out how it functions, but to reproduce it artificially, or rather, to build it, for what that is worth.
Lewis Carroll and Alice in Wonderland
The first progress in the field of AI began when Alan Turing, inspired by the literary character from the Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, set out to devise a simple test for determining whether a machine could really be considered intelligent. To do this he devised a test that, over the years, became known as the Turing Test, and it consists of two procedures.
One is the analysis of the language of a machine, which has to be able to pass for a man or a woman; the

At first this story was funny, but after a while it started to seem like some kind of weird afterschool special. I really hope there are more dental jokes to come.
OMG these last few comments were hilarious, especially griffindork's.
The page with the tooth fairy was hilarious too, hehe.
This page made me crack up, such as...
Bleeding gums? Did you fall on a giraffe? (Bwaaaahahahahaha! )

lol, I was thinking that too.
I love the banana joke.
Interesting backstory, no idea where to even begin with this one.

Comments about "After Dentists" here: http://www.homestarrunner.com/forum/index.php?topic=13949.0
The twins say... (to each other): "I WANT A BANANA!"
I'm a bit uncomfortable at how sexual this thing is. I know it's supposed to be a comedy, but they keep mentioning her being nude, plus the tooth fairy kidnaps little girls' teeth. If she ends up being a ghost then, uh, that's bad too.
I kind of want this to be a continuation. This would be a really freaky dentist.
There's nothing sexual about this, and the "Eternal Night" motif isn't new either. Just because it mentions genitals and teeth, doesn't mean it's sexual in nature.
Besides, this IS a cartoon meant to be a comedy. Obviously they're going to use sexual humor to get a laugh. The joke about the twins saying "I want a banana!" sounds like it's from a rather demented after-school special, as mentioned above, so... yeah. I'm not sure what you expected. If the twins were using any innuendo or swear words, then you might have a case. But when the youngest characters in the entire H*R cartoon universe are telling the rest of the cast "I want a banana!", then I'm just going to chalk it up as that.

What a terrible dentist, at first I thought he was gonna kill them and put their teeth in a box.
Although i must say that if you think about it the puns could be a lot worse,
"He should buy the cd, or else he'll have to die for not having heard of it."
"He should buy the cd, or else he'll be left behind."
"He should buy the cd, or else he'll need a tooth fairy to give him candy for a tooth he lost."
See? THAT is the worst you could do with a cd pun.
The cartoon was not that bad though, i guess it would be alright for the Homestar runner crowd.
By the way, why does Strong Mad say his brother is a geek? I don't recall anything like that on this cartoon... maybe later, i can't remember anymore.
@Imvenotin
The puns could've been worse, but then again, considering who it's for, it's not very funny at all.
And another thing: If you think it's not sexual, you're absolutely wrong. There are many a case for it. For example, it's an oral scene with no clothes, and the characters in a sexual position, AND a ghost taking a girl's tooth is at least sexual.
You do have a point that they aren't that sexual, but I'm sure a 13-year-old who's parents don't know about Homestar Run

2024-09-25 03:24:48,470 - Prompt 60: The mysterious stranger in town had a story that
2024-09-25 03:24:48,470 - Generated text:  many people chose to ignore. The little church on the edge of town was willing to give him a home for now. But there was something not quite right about him. Like his eyes, they bore into the heart of the community, not so much judging, but perhaps asking “why”?
The first day, he seemed lost, yet the next day he seemed more focused. Like many loners he tended to withdraw from others. But then they thought he would be better company.
His accent was strange, something they had never heard. His story, they said, was a little fantastic. They were willing to let him stay, but not so much his story. He had a gift. He claimed to be a medical doctor. When he diagnosed what the illness was that one of the men in town had, many were ready to accept it, but some, not so much.
He sat at their meal and he ate, as if he was enjoying the meal. At least he had the decency to enjoy the meal, right? At least he was willing to eat. That’s all that mattered right? But still they hesitated, the accent and the story wasn’t quite right. After all, he seemed so sincere.
After that meal, the men decided to take a walk together. They wanted to see more of the stranger. They had known him only a few days. They walked by a local stream, away from the town.
As they walked they talked. As they talked, they spoke of that day, a very dark day. They were lost. It was easy for the stranger to ask “who is in charge around here?” The stranger said “I’ve never seen more lost sheep than here, and I’m not just talking about the wooly type.” The men could not figure out what he was saying.
The story of the wanderers was familiar. It was a story from a long time ago. But did he mean what he was saying?
As they sat on the hill, the sun was setting. The air had begun to turn cold.
“If you are here to help me, let’s see you get me out of here” a man said.
He started to put on his coat, which he had taken off in the summer heat. He thought this was a good sign. He took off his hat and placed it gently on the ground.
The men around him sensed something. They did not know how to describe what was happening, but they were afraid. They were afraid because they did not understand what was happening. They were afraid because the stranger did not care about their fear.
He stood up, he was over seven feet tall, and he was a big man. He took a slow, deep breath, a sigh. The group of men got out of their seats. This was not going to be good. As he stood up he seemed taller, thicker, more powerful. There was something different about him. They were scared. He started to walk down the hill, looking at each of them. He stopped before the man who had said “let’s see you help me” and he put his hand on the man’s shoulder.
“He is a deceiver, he is leading us astray” a man said.
“I am a man who has come down from God. Whoever is for me is against me, and whoever is against me is for me.” He said. He then turned and started to walk away.
The men were shocked. Who was he? Was he God?
“You have answered correctly. I am he” he said.
“It’s hard to understand God” the man said.
The stranger began to walk away, but turned to face them, looking at them, searching their hearts, and he asked “do you understand who you are and who you are not?”
The men turned away. He was speaking as if he was more God than they were. How could that be? How could anyone be greater than God? Was this man from God or the devil?
The stranger, Jesus, began to walk towards the town, no longer following the men. They looked at each other, but the man who had seen Jesus as an angel looked at the others and said “didn’t you see who that man was?”
The stranger, Jesus, came to town. People had become used to his presence. He came in peace, in power, in hope. He spoke healing. They heard his words of hope and peace. He was a leader of the people.
His words gave life to the spiritually dead. The people could not help but to love the way he spoke. His life and words had helped their lives.
As a result, the religious leaders hated him. They didn’t hate him because

It is the late 1970s in Bainbridge, England. On the outside, the town appears to be a gentle English village. But the residents are not what they seem to be.
Sally Montgomery is in trouble. Two decades earlier, her father had been accused of brutally murdering a young boy, and the murder weapon was said to have been a silver cross he had given to her. Now her infant daughter is missing, and she has no place to go. All the inns in Bainbridge are owned by nasty people. Her only hope is to stay in the empty manor house she used to visit as a child.
Forty-three years later, Dr. Mara Hasse’s dreams are haunted by memories of what she experienced as a nine-year-old girl. Mara begins to unravel the mystery of the real-life witches in Bainbridge who existed at a time when the Church decreed them to be possessed by the Devil.

THE WEIRD RIVER by Tom Taylor: Mervyn Peake
The brilliant and acclaimed Gormenghast trilogy not only set the standard for all future fantasy novels, but also served as a mythic literary context for all the fiction of Mervyn Peake. The Weird River is his second book in the posthumous Peake sequence, a fantasy novel based on Peake’s children’s stories and set in the time of mythic Britain, the Age of Iron.
Drawn from the same world as Gormenghast, The Weird River is a story of queens and princes, magic and swords, prophets and warriors, as seen through the eyes of young Prince Golden Fairhair and his friends. A few years before the end of the world, that is, at the time of mythical Cymric Britain, the wanderings of Prince Golden Fairhair take him along the Weird River, an inland sea that moves through the land. There he encounters a lost race, the Riders of the Dark, who are in possession of a strange lanthorn whose light serves to illuminate the face of doom.
Peake’s intricate and detailed drawings decorate the book, re-creating the lost city of the Weird River and its inhabitants in all their wealth and wonder, their blades and banners, armor and insignia.
The first edition of The Weird River was limited to 150 copies, signed by the author, for his collectors. This special paperback edition, which is printed in black and white on acid-free paper, contains an added selection of Peake’s artwork, almost all unpublished.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,471 - Generated text:  the next fight over freedom of speech. The Federal Government's Communications and Multimedia Content Forum (MCMC) has proposed to mandate at least 30 minutes of Malay content per hour of the time slot and has also banned stand-up comedy shows as well as other types of comedy performances such as magic shows, mannequin shows and even street performances. The current stand-up comedy trend in the country - think Yukiboy, Laugh Kaki, Mambo Chronicles, That's The Funny Show, to name a few - is seen as contravening MCMC's proposals for a more localised entertainment and one that could create disunity among people. While the proposed rules are still awaiting approval by the Home Ministry, actors and comedians are already questioning the recent actions by MCMC.
"Even for this particular proposal, I don't know if we've managed to present a proper case for it. We've been given the mandate, this will affect Malaysians, so we have to be able to justify why we have to do this. You must be able to answer the 'why', why must you do this and why can't you do this instead," producer of local variety TV shows Zaharuddin Musa, who was also a writer of stand-up comedies until recently, told The Nut Graph in a phone interview.
It is unclear why MCMC wants to restrict foreign acts in Malaysia, but Zaharuddin says that there's no such issue in any other country. "You see every country will allow local and foreign acts to perform there, but in this country they're not allowing. They're blocking foreign acts to come and perform here. I wonder why?"
DAP politician Anthony Loke, however, has criticised MCMC's move for being anti-development. Loke wrote an opinion piece titled A more insidious tool of oppression in which he questioned the act as a testament of a declining Malaysia.
"We were doing well and thriving, attracting millions of tourists every year. Foreign tourists and their money was essential to sustain our economy. Now we are heading towards becoming a 'laughing-stock' in the world. In order to attract tourists to visit Malaysia again, we need to rebuild our image abroad.
"Our economy is in a dire situation and as if our situation wasn't bad enough, our government keeps digging the hole deeper and deeper. So far, the government hasn't made any sensible decisions to improve our situation and we are heading in the wrong direction. How ironic," he wrote.
MCMC's proposal may ultimately impose censorship on public events and activities. One of the roles of MCMC is to safeguard the national language, i.e. Malay, in the media. Yet, the proposal is not only to apply to the performing arts, but also to the broadcasting industry.
"If you do not show 30 minutes of local content, you will have to go back and work. So do you think a few million people are going to be dismissed, or all the other people working in the media are going to be dismissed? I think that is something that needs to be discussed.
"We need to discuss the issue of whether we need censorship or not. Why do we need censorship? We need censorship because we cannot tolerate a level of disunity in society," Zaharuddin said.
He added that it is worth looking at the content we are currently providing. Zaharuddin said that Malaysians enjoy watching and listening to things that make them laugh.
"Malaysians like to laugh. We are not capable of having a show that we can sit through and enjoy. Our creativity can't be up to that level. This is our identity. We like to laugh and it is okay for us to laugh. I think we should accept it and start working at the level of our ability," Zaharuddin said.
Another local comedy artist – Manjit Singh, 30 – thinks that Malaysia's "culture of censorship" has always been an issue. He also thinks the restriction on foreign artists will hurt Malaysia's creative industry.
Singh was one of the stars in Mambo Chronicles, a local comedy group that produced Malaysia's first stand-up comedy television series. Mambo Chronicles has also been screened on Hong Kong's TVB Pearl, an affiliate of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited.

A companion to the major BBC and Nat Geo documentary marking the 60th anniversary of the first successful expedition to the summit of Mount Everest.
The inspirational true story of the first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953.
On 29 May 1953, an enormous crowd stood on the banks of the River Thames to wave off the third Everest expedition. But the mission did not have the heroic figurehead of Hillary as he was still recovering from a broken leg sustained earlier that year. Rather, the climbers were led by a remarkable and humble adventurer, Sir John Hunt, who had never scaled higher than 5,000m.
An unassuming figure, the genial Englishman did not quite match the profile of an Everest leader. An ex-Gurkha officer who had fought in WWII and took part in the famous 1946-7 reconnaissance trip to Everest with Tenzing and Hillary, Hunt was a well-known and respected figure in Everest-circumstances. He had a touch of the rogue and a good nose for adventure. On this expedition, Hunt brought an unusual diversity of nationalities with him: a German scientist, a Swiss cameraman and 13 climbers from six countries, representing a show of goodwill and internationalism following the ravages of the war.
With 12 months to prepare, Hunt insisted on meticulous planning, including experiments with a special new climbing device, the 'safety hoop', which had the potential to transform the dangerous business of ascending. Having won the lottery of being able to choose his final four-man summit team, the climbers set off from the Rongbuk Monastery for the final time on 10 March 1953. Their immediate objective was to establish base camp at 5,400m, halfway up the mountain and three times higher than Everest's north-east ridge, where they intended to make their final assault.
As 1953 was the hottest year on record in Nepal, much of the dangerous route was soaked with the runoff from melting snow. As they forced their way up the rocky slopes, the Sherpas' porters struggled to carry supplies to the upper camps. Only the veterans - young Tenzing, Hillary's Tibetan cook, Sen Tenzing Norgay and Ang Nyima - were up to the task.
And then, a terrible climbing accident happened on the south-east ridge, which had never been climbed. Pending the outcome, the team's future - and perhaps their lives - was thrown into doubt. After 19 days' climbing, the expedition reached Advanced Base Camp. They had successfully overcome the worst of the mountain and were now, amazingly, only 3,500m from the top.
Taking things one step at a time, they established Camp II at 6,500m and Camp III at 7,200m. One by one, the team climbed to Camp IV - a 10,000m lofty camp where there was no protection from the notorious high-altitude winds. It was a battle for survival as they waited to climb to the summit in one go.
Anderson weaves an emotional and gripping account of these two extraordinary weeks, which ended in Sir John Hunt watching his two favourite climbers as they stood on top of the world, and he himself receiving the Order of the Garter at Buckingham Palace. The drama of these final days is filled with superb storytelling and rich descriptions of the geography and landscape of the Himalaya. Using first-hand accounts from the climbers, Anderson charts the dangerous days on the mountain and the harrowing descent to Base Camp - an experience

In this frantic puzzle adventure game, you must take control of an airship that will move only according to the elements (wind, rain, snow, and clouds) to collect the treasures and bring back the elements in a desperate attempt to rebuild the weather. But beware of cat-astrophe, because cats might cause a flood!
Clouds of Fury utilizes beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds and characters to create an absorbing world in which you must save a town from total destruction. The puzzles involve moving an airship along a track, using wind and clouds and making adjustments when elements change. This unique style of play makes the game quite addictive, and players have been quick to see the appeal of the game. You must learn to master the elements in order to bring back the weather. The game is a real mash-up of ideas, and this mix of elements (literally) and the graphic style of the game will immediately draw you in to this wild ride.

The name of the company behind the game was "Valadon" (they used to develop games for Sierra) and it is a reference to French painter Utrillo. That's all I can find about the company. I was unfamiliar with the game until I tried it a few weeks ago. The cartoonish gameplay is a bit hard to learn, but once you do, it gets quite addictive. Unfortunately, after playing it for the first time I found it impossible to restart. If you want to play the game, do so before reading the reviews. I hope I get the chance to play it again someday and write a review that is a little more informative.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,471 - Prompt 66: The old fisherman's tales of the sea were both captivating and
2024-09-25 03:24:48,471 - Generated text:  awe-inspiring. With that being said, it is only natural that a well-known legend about The Devil's Rocks has made its way from the stories of Cornwall and Ireland. The following is a tale of a treacherous place that is rumored to be haunted by the devil.
The Devil's Rocks
The old fisherman of yesterday told the story of the Devil's Rocks on the Cornish coastline.
They said that long ago a prince's ship was captured by the devil, and the prince's men and women, including the prince, were thrown overboard. The prince's body was found on the shore but his soul was stolen by the devil.
On stormy nights you can still hear the princess's voice calling out, "Come back, come back," as the rocks thunder against each other.
Several ships have been lost on The Devil's Rocks, and numerous ships have been blown off course by the dangerous winds.
The name of the area was changed to Cape Cornwall to prevent any further boats from being caught by the treacherous rocks.
Stories of an unusual farmhouse and its occupants keep many locals and visitors away from Porthgwarra, just north of Cape Cornwall. The house is said to be built on the site of a cave, and within the cave a witch resides, looking out of her window in the cliff wall. People say she looks out with greedy eyes at anyone who approaches. She has the appearance of a witch because she is a hag.
The Devil's Mark
People in the area say that on stormy days a group of men can be seen sitting on a rocky outcrop on the Devil's Mark. It is said that the wind blows so hard at this location that no one will pass there. The Devil's Mark is a prominent landmark in the area.
There is a popular saying in the area, which is based on the witch in the caves. It says that if a cottage is built on a site where a witch resided it is doomed to be haunted for the rest of time. This is a common saying in Cornwall and Devon, and it is believed that a witch still resides in one of the cottages in Porthgwarra. It is said that a medium attempted to exorcise the witch's spirit, but he failed and the witch still remains.
It is believed that the Devil's Mark is haunted. A footstep can be heard across the rocks, and at night people claim to hear a ringing sound. A ghostly figure has also been seen walking between the caves.
It is rumored that a giant black dog once lived at the farmhouse and caused havoc among the farmer's livestock and crops.
A derelict house near Porthgwarra is said to be the home of a sinister spirit. The spirit has been seen on several occasions by curious locals, and even a blind man has claimed to have seen the spirit. The house is now sealed off by a small wall, but locals claim that the wall does little to prevent the ghost from manifesting.

Readers, I am the blogger for this site. I would love to hear from you, please post any comments, stories, etc. about your experience with ghosts.
My uncle lived on a farm in Cornwall for a while. I love that area, and am glad to know of more legends and stories from that beautiful region. One more thing about the house built on the old witch's location. Some of the homes in New Orleans are built on the sites of old plantations where, as you might guess, some were Voodoo practitioners.

In that scant few seconds, the fear of the darkness pounded into me. The fear that with every wrong move, the person we chased would be able to get us as well. It was terrifying. It was enough to give any of us nightmares, and it's not like any of us needed more stress in our lives.
The shovel slid from our hands and landed with a thud somewhere behind us. A second later we saw it with our eyes and recognized it with our minds. The air around me and Holly, along with the entire world, held its breath. After a few seconds of everything going dead silent, someone sneezed.
It was the very last sound we would ever hear.
My sister and I stared at the shovel like it was a grenade.
It was disgusting.
She's been staring at my feet for the last few minutes now, and every time I shift positions, so does she. It's a little rude, and very awkward, but I can't seem to take my eyes off of her either. I try to focus my eyes on something else, but every time I do, her face pops into my mind.
Her face. Her frickin' cute little face that I haven't seen in years. She had changed so much. Longer hair, a longer body, and a rounder face. She looks so much like our mom.
I mean, we both do.
"Carly, what's the name of the detective in this game?" my sister whispers.
"Watson," I answer her.
"And what does he do for a living?"
"He's a doctor."
"And what other cases have he and the famous Sherlock Holmes been on together?"
"Dozens."
"What's his last name?"
"And what does his last name start with?"
"And how old is he?"
I yawn again and try to turn my head in her direction, but she quickly moves. "I asked you a question."
"I know, I'm sorry. Do I know?"
She flips her hair over her shoulder. "Yes."
"And that's it?" I ask, crossing my arms. "Just that?"
She stops and raises her brows at me. "That's pretty much it."
"That's pretty much all I ever got out of you. The Sherlock Holmes thing."
She snickers. "Yeah, but Sherlock Holmes was not in this game. Watson was, so it makes sense I would pay a little more attention to him."
"He's real. Like the real deal."
"He's not really real."
"And that guy wasn't real either, but you sure acted like he was."
She bites her lip and stares down at the table. "Honestly, I loved him. He was such a good guy. The best brother any girl could ask for. I couldn't believe he had to die."
The house sounds had lessened from a few minutes ago, but they had now returned with a new vengeance. It felt like the quiet in the room was screaming out to be broken. I coughed to break the silence. "Well, if it makes you feel any better, he's not actually dead."
Her head shot up and she glared at me. "What did you say?"
"I said, I think the ghost of my imaginary brother is on the floor, ready to scare you."
"What ghost?"
"The ghost of your imaginary brother."
"That was my imaginary sister."
I laugh, not even bothering to hide it. I can't hide my laughter. Not in front of her.
She doesn't seem to think it's funny.

With a young heroine, Ethel, who has been sold into slavery and a wizard's convention that goes terribly wrong, this fantasy adventure will appeal to fans of Brian Jacques's Redwall series.
"Lively and quick-moving. . . . Readers will definitely be rooting for Ethel and her toaster."
"Will do nothing but delight readers of all ages."
"Brennan has crafted a wizarding world like no other. . . . Ethel is a perfect protagonist--down-to-earth, brave, kind, and hilarious."
— Betsy Bird, A Fuse #8 Production, A Fuse #8 Production blog
"Brennan has created another terrific fantasy story, and this time, it’s got teeth. . . . Readers will have fun while reading and following along with the chaos."
"Talented author Brennan offers up more fun and adventure, this time with a lot of zaniness. Intrigue, plot twists and action all come together for another fun read."

Series: Ethel Cuteale
A Wizard's Convention
MuciBabbi. MuciBabbi. MuciBabbi. It was loud. The Wizarding Convention was loud. It was loud and it was fun. There were the nicest people you could hope to meet, all there to have fun, which made it even louder.
I like to say I was the quietest, kindest wizard I know. Unfortunately, this was not true. I was also the least powerful wizard I knew. Not a good combination.
My name is Ethel Cuteale. I am a witch. My parents are the witches and wizards Cute and Ale. I spent my early years in an orphanage, where my best friends were a tub of margarine and a sink plunger. By the time I was nine years old, the orphanage was closing, and my first true friend, Mr. Tub, was dumped in the garbage.
My parents took me home to their village, where they were eager to teach me all they knew. They didn't teach me to be powerful, however. They were happy to teach me how to do normal things like sweep and peel potatoes, but none of my spells were doing anything. At twelve years old I was still blowing things apart with my magic, so my parents had me apprenticed to a wizard. He made me scrub dishes, polish brass, and wash his cat. He wasn't a particularly nice man, but he was powerful.
My parents died when I was eighteen. They were caught up in the Great Tsunami of '77, along with half the rest of my village. Mr. Cat came home, so I knew he had to be saved, but my only hope was to figure out the spell I needed and practice it, and that was extremely hard to do when I was hiding from the giant stomping creatures called tidal waves.
I managed to do a very small thing. I spotted some of my village's largest surviving ducks and put them in a sack. Their legs tangled and flapped, but I had them. I grabbed a couple of eggs from a farmhouse and handed them to the ducks. The eggs seemed to take the edge off their panic. I wasn't sure what would happen next, but it was definitely going to be an adventure.
It didn't take long before I met another duck, a perfectly nice drake. He had a few scratches, but he was clean and beautiful. We fell in love on the spot and had our duckie babies the next year. The following year we had triplets. Since I was living on

2024-09-25 03:24:48,471 - Generated text:  salvation. With nothing to his name but a massive pile of socks and a sick adolescent daughter, Spud has to fight through a pitch-black underworld where boiling molten gold is the norm. But who can he trust? The viscious warden who rules with a fierce iron fist, the baby-faced bartender who gives him a few fighting chances, or maybe even a leather-clad thug with a soft spot for socks.
I'm sure most of you will understand my frustration at getting to the point in this book where I had to keep putting it down, and picking it back up only to repeat this routine in the 30% range. Of course, you would also probably never guess how many times I started to DNF it, and how many times I picked it back up with the intention of finishing it, and how many times I told myself I could leave it alone this time. It took me almost four weeks to get through 51% of this. I was dying to know what was going on, why Spud's daughter, Winnie, was sick, and what could make these people such terrible humans.
Then I got to 53% and I decided I would put it down for good. I just couldn't do it anymore. Every single character was annoying, every single action or dialogue was made with no purpose other than to further the story in a way that really didn't make any sense to me at all. I love Spike Milligan (and Nostradamus too!), I can appreciate the idea behind this, but the writing itself left me rather baffled and unconvinced that I should care at all about Spud or his daughter, even if the message is a good one.
The most frustrating part is that I wasn't bored, which is what usually stops me from giving up on a book. I'd still pick it up and start reading it again after a while, and this happened more than once, which is what ended up happening in the end. I just felt I had no patience to keep reading, when there are so many others I want to read. On the other hand, this book has me curious enough to look into the author's other works, in the hope that maybe there are some that are good and not just so bloody difficult to read.
The Good, The Bad, The Spud will be released in paperback on January 12th.

Welcome to the Harlem Renaissance!
And I have a special treat for you today! A creative, imaginative, and important time in American history has been brilliantly written by Kekla Magoon, who did the unthinkable by taking a time period that doesn't really interest me and making it exciting. Not only that, but it doesn't forget about the LGBT community of this era, the first time I have ever read about that side of history in my life.
There are many well-known poets and authors from this time period, but there were also other writers, performers, photographers, and many more, whose work never made it into mainstream. This includes the main character, Zora Neale Hurston, whose gift for storytelling takes her on a journey to the Harlem Renaissance, but doesn't give her a ticket back home. This is her chance to make a name for herself, to let the world see her skills, and let them know she is here, in her world. But she's very much aware that not everyone is willing to see past her skin, or even respect her as a writer, and some of those are other blacks, too. It's easy to see why she's so determined to not let anyone know where she's from, or that she's trying to earn a place in the hottest new trend in the country.
We also have two other important characters in this story, Cudjo and Genevieve, a married couple who are both passionate about photography, and Cudjo about history. This makes it easier for Zora to tell her story, to the extent that she feels comfortable with him. Genevieve is everything she isn't, or at least thinks she isn't. A woman with money and opportunity, and passion for the things she enjoys. She was a huge help in keeping Zora's identity a secret, and with that, she also helped her learn more about herself. It was so much fun seeing how these two characters helped each other. I'm so glad Genevieve's real, unique personality wasn't swayed by Zora's own inse

2024-09-25 03:24:48,472 - Generated text:  tree. The boys would often squat in the dark, by the roots and listen as the drip of rain wove a magical tune with the beat of their hearts.
They'd chat about adventures and dreams. Dreams of another life. One that had the promise of their own villages. The promise of their mothers' home made food, and the gentle love of their fathers who held their hands as they crossed over the threshold and onto a bed with clean sheets.
And those dreams began to grow within. The beauty of these small villages spoke to them. The landscape shifted from their eyes to their hearts. And as they were growing older, their goals of a city life, shrank to the size of an ant.
The fear grew in them. Fear of never experiencing that feeling of their hearts filling with their village's beauty.
The man gave a nod to the boy as he helped him up. He led him back towards the village, to another tree. It was night and the light from a full moon lit the path with a surreal glow.
As they walked, the boy couldn't help but notice that the last tree they had passed had two raindrops hanging from its branches. They glowed blue and he could tell that they were filled with magic. The boy felt a slight shift in the way that the man carried himself. He could sense that something was different.
He spoke, "I have a secret, one that I'm telling you, not for you, but for myself. It's one that I wanted to share but thought that it might be best to keep to myself. To no longer hide it and keep it from my brothers. To share it with them, as they stand before me. The magic within you is real. We were chosen to find this tree, and this treasure, and to lead all others to it. With the help of my brother and the tree's branches, we will be able to harness the magic and create a portal to lead people to the beautiful villages that have been buried and hidden away."
A slight smile shone upon the boy's face as he listened, as he felt his heart fill with a happiness that had been lost, for so long.
Suddenly, they reached the tree. There was no drip of rain to be heard, for it was night. And no leaves could be seen beneath the branches, for they were too high up to be reached.
The boy turned back to the man, who stood by the tree. The moon was so close that the boy could almost reach it with a jump.
"The man reached out with both of his hands and took one of the raindrops that hung from the branches. He held it for a moment and then tossed it to the boy.
"Hold on to this, it will guide you towards your home. And don't forget about our promise to bring others with you. We have a village to find. And once we do, it will be filled with magic and love."
The boy listened to the last words of the man. He felt himself fall into the magic of the night. Into a world that he hadn't experienced in years. His vision blurred as the last memory of the man faded from view.
He let out a soft sigh. As he made his way towards the bright light that lay in front of him. He could see a small village, in the distance.
One that was filled with happiness and magic.
The boy continued his walk and made his way towards the entrance of the village. He took his time, but suddenly, something flashed in his mind.
A dream of another village. A village that was buried beneath the thickness of the deepest snow. A dream of winter. A dream that seemed so long ago.
He pulled the treasure out of his pouch. He examined it carefully, as he clutched the green vine, with five blue raindrops hanging from it.
A single tear dripped down his cheek as the winter village faded into the deep darkness.
As the boy entered the village, the warmth of it's inhabitants enveloped him. The love that they gave radiated outwards and the boys heart melted. He fell to his knees and cried. As he cried, he held onto the vine, which held the last memory of the first village.
He knew that his dream of the winter village had faded away, and that it would never return. He tried to feel sad, but instead, he felt full. Full of happiness and love.
He heard a voice from behind him, "Hey, you ok? Are you ok?". He quickly stood up and turned to the source of the voice, "Yes, yes I am, it's

Experimental musicians have made use of extended techniques for many years, however, only few of them found more or less permanent place in repertoire. But dozens of such techniques should help the musical student in developing their own inner musical abilities and in understanding music composition and performance better. A separate list of some 30 more singing techniques for male and female singers should be available soon.
The most famous singing technique for the voice is the vibrato. It should be included in every list of singing techniques because it is so well known and so important in the singing world. The vibrato is a characteristic sound feature that can be both produced and detected by the ears.
If we talk about a singing technique, we usually think of ways of voice production, like breathing, tongue, or jaw position, or we speak about use of the voice such as tone, timbre, resonance and pitch.
If you ask what the most common singing technique is, you will hear a lot of different answers. But the truth is that most of the time it will be the same answer, vibrato. Vibrato is an extremely important singing technique for its ability to alter a pitch through slight changes in frequency, and this technique is used by both professional and amateur singers.
Vibrato is used to bring attention to pitch. Vibrato is a way of vibrating the pitch as you sing it. Vibrato is a pitch fluctuation and it is produced by a muscle in your diaphragm that is connected to your vocal chords.
Vibrato is most commonly heard on higher-pitched instruments, such as flutes, violins, and singing voices. A common example is the violin vibrato, where the performer slightly changes pitch from note to note.
In singing, vibrato is the ability to produce or create a wavering and pulsating tone in the voice. Singers can achieve vibrato by vibrating or shaking their vocal chords. Vibrato is a singing technique most commonly associated with opera singing.
It is often confused with tremolo, another vocal technique, but the vibrato results in a fluctuation in pitch, while tremolo results in a fluctuation in volume. A vibrato is a specific form of tremolo.
Vibrato and tremolo are singing techniques which work together. Vibrato is the production of a wavering, shaking quality to the voice which may vary in amplitude, but is not necessarily detected as a pitch change.
In opera, the vibrato is an important singing technique used to create the richer, more natural tones heard in opera. A singer creates a vibrato by vibrating or shaking their vocal chords, producing a wavering and pulsating tone.
Vibrato is a singing technique in which a singer varies the pitch of a tone. The process of vibrato is an involuntary action, a result of the highly flexible membranes in the vocal folds being excited by an alternation of internal muscle contractions. Vibrato is the fluctuation or modulation of pitch produced in an instrument or a singing voice.
A vibrato is created by changing the speed of the vocal chords as you sing, creating a shimmering quality to the voice. Vibrato is commonly used in opera singing and can enhance the sense of depth and richness of the voice.
Vibrato is a singing technique in which the pitch is wavered or swayed, rather than maintained at a constant level. It is a physical mechanism which allows the human voice to achieve resonance and is most commonly heard on higher pitched instruments, such as the violin or flute.
Vibrato is a singing technique used by the performer to add richness, emotion and resonance to a performance. The singing voice and an instrument can both be given a vibrato effect, which is achieved through subtle changes in the muscles around the larynx, causing the vocal cords to vibrate.
Vibrato is used to bring attention to pitch, emphasize a note or passage of a melody, and to express different moods or emotions. Vibrato is a vocal singing technique, which is used by many vocalists. It is used to create a note or a melody, which has a vibrating quality to it.
Vibrato is a singing technique that involves fluctuations in pitch or the intensity of a tone or sound. In singing, vibrato is often used to create an expressive quality in a vocal performance. Vibrato, an effect that is created by the singer

A cool breeze caught her shoulder and she gripped the wall until the voices faded. She stopped to catch her breath. Listened carefully to the silence, alert for any noises coming from the tunnel.
Too many times in the last few months she’d had to hunt, to protect the people she loved, but always in the dark, never sure who was hunting her. It was different today. She faced no enemies but herself, as she and Betsy had warned. Her own actions would bring danger to the people she loved. But it was the only way to save them. If she didn’t do this, then they’d never escape the facility and they’d all die.
Most of the recruits, those like her, were drawn from the underground world, seeking protection from the larger one that was corrupt and evil. She’d been naïve enough to believe there were good people in the world, that kindness and compassion could come from any person.
But she was starting to see that it wasn’t so simple. She’d been raised in a good home, in a good community, but that no longer existed. Everything had changed. The world was filled with people just like her, those who had learned how to fight, how to defend themselves. Only now they had all the tools and weapons necessary to create a slaughterhouse and profit from it.
How had she not seen the truth sooner? She’d grown up in a small town with good people. She’d been blessed to have people who loved her. But she’d lived under a false illusion, and when she realized what was happening, it had been too late to turn back.
When the shooting started, she’d run.
She’d run, right into Betsy, into her home, into her safe place. They’d come together as a team, learning how to handle weapons, how to fight, and how to use their surroundings to their advantage. They’d gone on missions, creating a network of allies. They’d done everything in their power to keep others safe.
All in vain. The facility, where they had been sent to be “protected,” had turned out to be the worst of the worst. They had been beaten, abused, and forced to fight other recruits in the facility’s sporting events, a twisted mixture of entertainment and fight to the death.
But not all the recruits were men. When it came time to fight, when they forced her and Betsy to square off against each other in an arena in front of hundreds of bloodthirsty men, Betsy had been victorious.
Pulling off her jacket, she gripped it in one hand, twisting it in the other. How had she gotten herself into this position? Who was the worse person in this situation, her or Betsy?
She’d been determined to keep Betsy safe. She’d had no other choice.
But now what? When Betsy went before the CEO and admitted to the harassment, the facility would come down on them both. They’d be moved to a different area, possibly the deepest, darkest part of the facility, never to see daylight again. They would be stuck in an endless, suffocating cycle, where they’d be forced to kill or be killed, until there was no one left to torture or use as a fighting entertainment.
This wasn’t what she wanted for Betsy, for the rest of the recruits. They’d lost enough. They deserved to escape this place and start over.
But Betsy was afraid to live on her own. She was a prisoner of the cages in her mind, afraid of what happened if she ventured outside them.
Rocks grinding beneath her feet, heels clacking on the ground, and it seemed the echoes came from a different tunnel. There was something different about these tunnels. They were much older, wider, and not nearly as full of dirt and debris. She strained her ears, listening to the slight change of sounds. There was another person walking this way. It was a man, and he was coming her way.
Swallowing hard, she turned the corner, trying to stay as far into the shadows as possible. She was a big person, and her size made her a mark in the dark.
The light was dim here, but she made out a man approaching. He seemed taller and thinner than the others who were in the facility. Her heart pounded in her chest as her gaze was drawn to

Not long ago, flying skyscrapers and such vast floating cities were considered the stuff of science fiction. But what if they’re not just dreams, but the realities of our future?
Here, on the adventurous edge of city living, the office worker will be caught by the gleaming, solar-powered city as she descends to the central train station. Impossibly tall buildings, each with hundreds of kilometers of clean lines and smooth surfaces, will shimmer in the sunlight.
High above, the soaring roofs will create a virtual landscape of vast, cloud-scapes. Massive cones hang like giant kites, stabilizing the overwhelming expanse.
The elevators will be truly transformative: they’ll be able to take you across the city to your destination in a heartbeat. Their smooth interiors, spacious and bright, will cut through the skies like a smooth, airborne snake. In the airport, you’ll see the lightest planes ever built.
These ships may be too small to have engines, but you can be sure that you’ll never go hungry while flying. Everything from the harvesting of food, to the construction of airports and every aspect of city planning will take place in this incredible environment.
As you leave the airport, you’ll notice a new skyline: this is a technologically advanced city, one built to outstrip the damage done by pollution and natural disasters.
The buildings are hollow, aerodynamic, and there are no windows; instead, a large, virtual screen replaces each.
The city is a city of the future; there is no doubt that it will be. If you’re looking for a dream city, take a peek inside.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,473 - Prompt 81: The bustling marketplace was alive with the sounds and smells of
2024-09-25 03:24:48,473 - Generated text:  the street food which surrounded its perimeter and, despite it being midday, the sun was piercing the bright blue sky with a vehemence that made the interior of the cathedral look like the perfect refuge from the glare. There were groups of people clumped together waiting, looking for a sign to guide them, even those that wanted the busiest time of day were full and on the lookout for customers who would be ditching their bags and food in favour of the refreshing, cool confines of the interior.
The forlorn figure of the young man was now drawn further towards the market stall and the small crowd of people that were beginning to make their way in the same direction. His gaze scoured the market as he weaved his way between the stalls and shoppers who were stretching across the sidewalk. The shuffling form of the girl that was standing in front of the stall stood out amongst the other figures who had been on the cobbled ground for longer than him and he found himself following her as she stood there quietly and waiting.
She turned her head and met his gaze. There was a nod and a quick smile that she threw in his direction and he was drawn to his feet. The guilt and shame that had been nestled in his gut threatened to bubble upwards and he felt his stomach threaten to lurch. He knew he was almost certainly meant to be back in the lecture hall, catching up on all the class work that he had not managed to get around to that day and that, in all likelihood, he had not even left his room for more than a couple of hours that day. And yet, he felt compelled to continue the direction that she had pulled him in and his feet were guided, slowly but surely towards the corner of the square.
There was a plate on a wooden stand that had been hung over the stall and that revealed the familiar logo that he had seen numerous times before. The boy’s eyes looked at the chunks of chicken and mushroom that had been cooked in a sauce and carefully arranged on the plate, and as he watched, the meat which sat on top of a bed of mashed potato began to sizzle. There was a small oval shaped casserole that had been filled with rice and an assortment of seasonings which was laid next to the beef that was sitting on top of the mashed potato. There was also a garnish of the leaves from an unfamiliar green plant that, when placed on top of the meat, gave the appearance of a green forest. He noticed that, despite the crowd that was now pressing in on him, nobody else in the market appeared to be looking at the offering on the plate. There was an intriguing smell that seemed to come from a dish that had something of an oriental flavour and he tried to suppress the urge that it had brought forth in his stomach.
She pulled a piece of cloth from a large shoulder bag that was slung across her chest and wrapped it around her hand and took the pile of notes which were on the table and placed it on the plate in front of the young man. There was the morsel of hope that she could perhaps raise enough money to cover the cost of what was owed and with that in mind, he continued to hold out hope. He took the money and tapped the notes that he had been given on to the wooden stall which acted as a guide to help those to place their order. There was a nod of thanks and the delivery of the dish to his side of the stand.
He took the money from the man who had served him the food and picked up the dish, careful not to let it fall from his grasp. The chicken had been cooked to perfection, and it was the middle of the piece of meat that was over the mashed potato that had made it so tantalizing. He turned and looked at the door and he knew that if he did not act quickly, then he would not have any chance of grabbing the food before it was consumed by one of the people who were waiting. He took his first bite and tasted the flavours that seemed to run through the chicken meat. There was a tang that was reminiscent of the spices and seasonings that had been used to make the dish and which gave the food a whole new lease of life. The smell had given a false impression that the food would be bland and uninteresting, but the taste had proved it wrong. He took another bite and the flavours that ran across his tongue were almost intoxicating and he turned to look at the girl who had been waiting for him with a glow of pride in her eyes.
He looked at the

Aurora Cabarrus didn’t want to come home to Jumping Jack River, Georgia, and she definitely doesn’t want to be here when her mother dies. But there’s a long-forgotten space artifact in the mountains and no one else can lead the expedition into its depths.
Along with a team of archaeologists and astronauts, Aurora plunges deep into the cosmic jungle where they encounter a host of dangers. But when disaster strikes, it’s Aurora’s knowledge of the comet’s history and how the ancients survived the long voyage from Earth that saves the team. She also learns more about herself, her family, and the reasons she left the red-rock hills behind.

His kingdom is great and beautiful; he loves his people and his kingdom, but he finds little joy in ruling. Only the arrival of the mysterious Lady Bronwyn awakens his passion for life and the world. Her magical touch rekindles his desire for his kingdom, his family, and his life. The only thing that keeps him from this passionate enjoyment is his love for his kingdom and the protection of his people.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,473 - Generated text:  sculptures, botanical displays, and shady trees. With it's ivy-covered walls and glorious gardens, it was almost possible to forget the history of the tragedy that was revealed upon discovering the vault below it.
While the rest of the house was demolished, the garden survived. Like the shadow of the past that it is, it's uninviting gate fell into disrepair and soon had become overgrown.
In the cemetery below, where many had been laid to rest, stood three gargoyles upon the wall. Wings unfurled, talons to the ready, no one ventured too near.
"What is this place?"
While mumbling an apology, she pressed on to the gate and pulled open the rusty iron. It groaned and whined, but it held.
An early morning breeze whispered of secrets and wilderness beyond, of freedom, and the open road.
She stared at the cemetery below and then looked up to the garden above.
Sometimes the past needs to be uncovered before it can be buried, and it's never too late to let the truth go free.

Love this story, especially the ending. It just felt hopeful. Like she was digging deep to uncover the truth and was ready to let it go. Nice job.

The King Solomon’s mines book is a reference to the Biblical King Solomon, who is known to have found a large deposit of gold on top of a mountain. This gold was later used to build the temple of Jerusalem. I have never actually read this book, but it has always been on my list of books to read. The story is based on a Jewish story about an ancient king who is trying to find an incredible amount of gold. It is also based on a folk tale from around the world. The tale was probably first told by the Phoenicians around 800BC. The name of this book is based on the fact that the Bible was written in Greek, and that the original word was the Phoenician word for gold. The book was written by King Solomon, but I haven’t read it. The word “mine” is used in many other languages, and I think it means “ore” or “ore deposits”. This is why I thought that the book was about King Solomon, and I chose to use it as a name for this book.

Today it’s not uncommon for a few members of a team to go through a ‘division of labour’ with each taking responsibility for particular tasks, be it organising a meeting, collecting the data, coordinating the delivery of work, doing an analysis, or even presenting the findings to the rest of the team and the client.
The results are predictable: everyone is busy, and no-one’s really collaborating. To the outside observer, it looks like everyone is happy and content. However, inside, feelings of frustration are being ricocheted around the group. For some, this can lead to an air of uncooperativeness. For others, it results in feelings of resentment, often culminating in feelings of injustice.
The beauty of collaborative meetings is that every individual is engaged, and all ideas are welcome. But this should only be the start. This is where the team really needs to work as a single unit, to make sure they deliver as one. A lot of effective collaborative meetings start and end in the meeting room. It’s how the members of the team take that extra step that creates the real results.
Perhaps it’s how a key individual reacts to what has been said. If that person continues to do what they’ve been doing for the past 5 minutes, all that’s been said will have gone to waste. We’re not saying that people should forget what they’ve said and ‘change tack’. Instead, they should use their knowledge, experience and innovation to look at how their comment can be actioned.
In this sense, the person who made that comment is essentially responsible for all the actions that have been agreed.
You know the one; when the meeting finishes and the group all go their separate ways, not bothering to let everyone know where they’re off to next.
If the meeting is going to run efficiently and smoothly, there needs to be some sort of systematic record. One of the problems with minutes is that they’re normally written by one person, and are thus only representative of their individual perspective. As such, if everyone’s not on the same page, the meeting isn’t going to get very far.
You should also take a moment to consider the importance of building relationships and trust. For effective collaboration, it’s essential that you’re working with an environment of mutual respect. If you find that there’s a problem with trust in your team, then it’s essential to make efforts to ensure that everyone gets a fair crack of the whip.
It’s not enough to say ‘we all need to collaborate more’. Everyone needs to be clear on what that means. As such, it’s essential to spend some time working out how exactly you want your team to collaborate.
Gathering together in a meeting room is essential. However, it’s equally important that your team collaborate out of the room.
So, how do you build collaborative meetings? Firstly, it’s important that you have the right number of attendees. If it’s a huge project, then 20 people won’t be necessary. At the same time, if it’s a relatively small project, then 15 won’t be enough.
The room set up is also important. Make sure that you can walk around the table, as this creates a much more open environment. It also prevents anyone from dominating proceedings.
It’s also worth noting that you shouldn’t have back-to-back chairs. Although this can create more of an ‘intimate’ environment, it can also create tension.
Another way of breaking down barriers is to change the seating positions on a regular basis. After all, it’s a lot easier to speak up when you’re sitting next to someone you’re on good terms with.
While it’s important to discuss ideas, it’s also important to have time for some quiet reflection. Without this time, the group will rush to come to a conclusion and might lose their way. Taking the time to reflect allows ideas to flourish.
Before the meeting, prepare everyone by making it clear exactly what you’re expecting from everyone.
If you want the group to be responsive to everyone, it’s a good idea to structure your meetings so that they flow from one task to the next, rather than adopting an ‘everyone can have a go’ attitude. If it’s a shared responsibility, you can focus the meeting around what’s expected from each of the attendees.

Woooow, Nicolas Cage in that movie?? *-* That could be fun!
Can’t wait for Salem!
I just came across this series because I was looking for Eastwick and I found this one which looks promising.
Looking forward to it. I think we will be seeing a lot of this series over the next few months as they rush to air to compete with True Blood.
I can’t wait for Salem! It looks really good. I’m so looking forward to seeing Ryan Eggold! He’s so pretty… And I don’t really know this actor… Nicholas Cage? Maybe I’ve seen his movies? Hmm, I think not… But he seems interesting… So I might go and watch this. I’m not really into this genre, but, who knows… Maybe it’s funny? lol! I’m not really into comedy movies. Hm. How funny will it be?
I hope I won’t get bored after a few minutes. I have a short attention span… xD
So it looks like it could be interesting. I am going to watch it! I might not love it, but, well… I still might love it. I don’t know. Anyway… I’m going to watch it!
I’m so looking forward to seeing Ryan Eggold! He’s so pretty…
Really ? Have I not seen his movies ? (because he’s in another TV Series called The Blacklist ?) Is he more famous than I thought ? Did I just not know him ?
He’s pretty cute in True Blood ! xD And I’m glad you like his character’s new haircut ! lol! I think it suits him ! xD
Jay Baruchel was cute too! He’s very funny! :D
I didn’t know him….I saw him a little in movie and never heard his name.
And you’re right. He’s hot. I had a crush on him since the beginning… But I think I was too young then… And he looked really young too. lol!
I didn’t know he had long hair then… He just looks way cuter in it! lol! I like short hair too. Like the actor in The Blacklist. :P He’s sooo handsome !
Yeah, they look so young… Now, Eric is so much older than him ! I never thought…
Yeah, they look so young… Now, Eric is so much older than him ! I never thought… ;)
They look exactly the same in True Blood. lol! xD
That’s so funny because the actor who plays Eric… looked so young in True Blood! I mean he’s older than Taylor Lautner in Twilight… But I didn’t realize it at all. I don’t know.
That actor looks so young. I’m not sure if he will be over 30 years old when he plays Eric.

Kirk Douglas’ beard needs to be trimmed. Is this a problem that comes with being the leader of the League of Extraordinarily Shy Superheroes?

All of the faces are fantastic. I don’t know how the superheroes got their fame, but they are all fabulous. The bearded guy is not extraordinarily shy though. He looks pretty cocky.

With a fresh mountain stream running through the vineyard, Good Earth does not go anywhere else. The wine flows like the river, smooth and silky. Unencumbered by sophistication, the juice is unaffected by scents of oak and other distractions. The simplicity of this wine makes it beautiful in its innocence.
The grapes of France and the winemaking tradition of Italy come together in a harmonious blend. The grape varieties and bottling techniques of each country allow the wine to taste both fruity and spicy. This is the perfect wine to enjoy with dinner.
Fruit, flowers and dark spice all meet in a delicious blend. In the tradition of famous dry reds, this wine also features a full, long, dry, red finish.
A sweet aroma of vanilla, smoke, spice and fruit linger in this blend, named for the beautiful waters and mountains of Iceland. The taste is dry and soft, yet full and flavorful, like the green hills of this northern nation.
Oregon produces more Pinot Noirs than any other wine producing state. Unlike California and Burgundy, Oregon’s cooler climate allows the fruit flavors to remain sweet and pure. The longer the grapes ripen, the more they taste like strawberries and raspberries.
The good wine of Italy is as delicious as it is mysterious. There are many types, all bearing a common name. But each is made from a different combination of grapes. The result of the blending can be complex or simple, sweet or dry, fruity or spicy.
Red wine is red because it contains coloring called anthocyanin. This coloring is sometimes removed during production by using carbon dioxide, and therefore no additional carbon dioxide is used in the bottling process.
Red wine is also aged in oak barrels, which contributes to its full-bodied flavor.
For many years, wines were aged in large clay vessels called amphorae, which resulted in a wine that tasted more natural. Modern-day fermentation techniques cause a wine to lose some of its natural flavors. Therefore, the quality of many wines lies in their longevity, and how much it has been affected by chemicals in the process of aging.
A sophisticated wine that is smooth with a finish, it gives the impression of completeness.
A simple wine with a taste that develops slowly.
A wine with very low acidity and great concentration of fruit flavors.
A wine that tastes of minerals.
Wine that is overly sweet.
A wine that tastes slightly salty.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,474 - Prompt 95: Unraveling the mysteries of the deep sea, researchers find
2024-09-25 03:24:48,474 - Generated text:  surprising planktonic behavior
Advances in imaging technology enable scientists to study behaviors of microscopic organisms in natural environments
Biological oceanographers use a variety of microscopes, drones and probes to collect information about the microscopic organisms that inhabit the ocean floor.
Using newly developed and advanced imaging technologies, scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) have discovered some surprising behaviors of a commonly observed type of plankton, known as appendicularians, that dwell in the deepest parts of the ocean.
Five decades of research into this microscopic plankton have yielded no clear picture of what these organisms eat or do under the constant pressure of the deep sea.
These findings offer a potential glimpse of the ecology of the deep sea, an environment on Earth that is among the most mysterious and least understood, but which is thought to be critical in the global carbon cycle and the food web.
The research was published in the July 18 issue of the journal Nature Communications.
“Our research shows that although appendicularians are widely thought to be simple filter feeders in the deep sea, they respond to environmental conditions by riding currents, swimming and occasionally even consuming the algal prey that they filter feed upon,” said Alexander Sinnett, a microbiologist at WHOI and lead author of the new study.
“These organisms might be influencing how much light energy gets transported through the ocean and potentially how carbon cycling occurs,” he said.
Normally microbes such as appendicularians are difficult to observe, because they are microscopic and live in deep, dark environments, so it is difficult to even see them.
Appendicularians, also known as Mesopod gastrotrichs, live in the deep sea, but are abundant in surface waters of the Southern Ocean. They are commonly found floating in surface waters from Antarctica to Australia, as well as occasionally in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean. They are often observed to drift with ocean currents and may use swimming motions to control their direction.
For years, researchers at WHOI and elsewhere have been trying to understand appendicularian behavior in nature. But, until now, they have lacked the means to observe appendicularians under natural ocean conditions.
“Our methods have allowed us to study appendicularians for the first time in their natural habitat,” said Sinnett. “We have been able to see appendicularians swimming, riding ocean currents, and even consuming food.”
This study used a variety of high-resolution imaging techniques, including drones equipped with advanced microscopes, to image and characterize appendicularians in situ, or in their natural habitat. The researchers also used miniature, subsea experiments to simulate conditions in the deep sea.
Sinnett said these experiments allowed researchers to test a variety of possible behaviors of appendicularians in the deep sea, including an open-ocean regime where the appendicularians travel in a direction downward with the ambient current. They also found that appendicularians change their behavior in their response to increased light levels. These behaviors could help appendicularians adapt to sudden changes in their environments.
“We have uncovered a variety of ecologically important behaviors and more basic ecological interactions among the microbes that help shape the ocean ecosystems,” said Sinnett. “We also suggest that the appendicularians and other similar organisms are perhaps playing a much greater role in carbon cycling than previously suspected, and their behavior could help us to better understand how the carbon cycles within the ocean.”
Sinnett added that some appendicularians appear to be consumers of dissolved organic matter, and they may control how much of this organic matter is transported in the ocean. In addition, appendicularians could be competing with other microbes in the deep sea for this organic matter and thus help to control how much of the organic matter is taken up by other organisms.
The appendicularians and other organisms like them that live on the ocean floor are so small that a human hair can be as big as a large whale. Yet these small organisms make up at least one-fifth of all life on the ocean floor, in deep water and in Antarctic surface waters.
“This study has shown us that we can learn a lot from studying microbes, and we need to learn more about their behaviors,” said Sinnett. “By learning how they behave in natural conditions, we can gain a better understanding of how microbes fit into the food web and how the carbon cycle works.”

2024-09-25 03:24:48,474 - Generated text:  a "sweetie-stretchy," monster that sucked away your love and brain cells. (CW)
The Sweetie-Stretchy
A stretchy monster with the ability to reach and suck out the brains and souls of people. Like a Rorschach, the monster is one of a kind, but it would stick out in a crowd of monsters because of its tail and stretchy mouth.
It is unknown if there ever was an actual monster to match the description of the Sweetie-Stretchy or if it was a tale used to scare kids into good behavior.
The creature's tongue would stretch and wrap around its prey, making its victims incapable of resisting it. It's jaw would then close and its teeth tear through the skull, making it easily capable of penetrating bones. Its stomach would then expand like a balloon, which was attached to its hind legs and tail, which gave it enough space for its victim to wiggle around within, in an attempt to prevent them from being sucked dry.
According to legend, the cave system was protected from people and other natural wildlife by a stone doorway that only monsters could pass. However, that doorway could be unlocked by means of 3 different "tokens" which were only obtained from far off lands. One of which was only able to be found once every 100 years.
The first token is acquired by using a magical eye drop. The user will hallucinate a large eye, that will eventually turn red. After taking off their contact lens, they will wake up on a remote island in the ocean. An hour later, they will be met by a huge blue whale who is holding the token that is needed to unlock the door.
The second token is also a contact lens that will grant the user the ability to turn into a purple bat. Once the wearer removes their contact lens, they will fly towards a cemetery that is buried in the desert. In that cemetery, is the token they need.
The third token is an old time looking sheriff hat. The wearer will arrive in the wild west, where a small and timid mouse wearing a raggedy white cowboy hat will be found. The token will only be obtained by battling the mouse and beating him at a game of dice. If you lose, he will taunt you by saying "Bite me."
Once all 3 tokens have been obtained, the wearer will be transported back to the island. There, they will meet a giant fish-man (a squid), who will lead them to a mysterious city that has been underwater for hundreds of years. There, in that city, is a giant statue of a dinosaur. The wearer will take the tokens from the statues mouth and use them to open the door. Inside the door is a hallway with a white carpet and stone archways lined down the hall. In that hallway, are the spores that will be needed to track the monster down. After 30 hours of sleeping under that spore, the wearer will awake inside of the underground caves.
The caves are made of light green and dark brown stone. There are also stone beds inside, that monsters can sleep in. There are also white carpeted hallways, with green and dark brown archways. In each archway, is a doorway that is only opened by the spores. The spores that were needed to track down the monster were different from the ones that were in the spore hallway. Those spores were only used to track down monsters that could not have been taken to the surface of the earth, where their bodies could be seen by humans.
The cave system is small, and the most important things for the wearer to focus on are the black rocks, that look like chocolate chip ice-cream. The wearer will find that, on each of those black rocks, is a red spider (with eyes) that will either have a mana totem on its belly, or a monster's name written on it in small red text. The wearer must collect the monsters name tokens and put them on the spore hallway, on top of the dried up, dead spores. Once all 3 spore names have been put on the spore hallway, the wearer will be teleported to a world that is very similar to the world where the tokens were obtained. Inside of that new world, the wearer will find a well that is made of pink stone. The wearer must make sure to lower the token into the well, before taking

LITTLE ROBOT CAT! THAT'S ME. LITTLE ROBO ...
Genre: Family,
Little Robot Cat! That's me.
Little Robot Cat, Robi, is a heffalump (Hufflepuff Cat). If you need an illustration for that, just ask me.
He's a good little cat, always trying to do his best. He knows his place in life, cleaning, loving and cuddling - that's his work. However, a few days ago, he was programmed to clean the school library and is happy to be doing that, even if he wasn't supposed to touch the books!
He accidentally meets a stray cat, Pockles, who introduces himself as 'Little Pockles Cat' and they start to become friends, even though Robi doesn't quite know what friendship is. The friendship is made up of lots of bumping into each other, with no interest in names.
They start to discover, together, the things that they both love about the library - and how messy it is! They soon work out that the messy library is because of a silly old old librarian, who has forgotten that one of her jobs is to keep the library clean and tidy. She also forgets, very regularly, to switch off the automatic cleaning system, which is why the library is always so messy.
Pockles thinks that the system is the problem - Robi doesn't understand why Pockles is talking to him at all. But before they have a chance to find out what is causing the mess, the librarian shuts off the automatic system. However, it also turns the robot off and it looks like the robot is lost forever.
But the librarian isn't sure if she's turned the robot off. She must turn the robot back on to find out if he's working! Robi knows that he needs to be turned back on to make sure that he's working - but he's not sure if he can make himself be turned on.
After lots of mishaps, mistakes and adventures, the robot is turned back on and Robi and Pockles, and the robot clean the library together!
The robot is put back in its cleaning program and is happy to be working, alongside Pockles, who he's also come to love.
Robi doesn't understand friendship, but he likes it anyway. He doesn't want to lose his friend - he wants to become a heffalump after all, and he can't do that on his own!
This is a funny, action-packed, imaginative adventure story. It's a fast-paced tale of friendship, which is an excellent exploration of what friendship is.
The illustrations are engaging, appealing and fun. The story is an interesting mix of silly, sad, funny, serious and adventurous. I loved it!
Dog in a Cake
Daisy is a dog.
You're a nice dog, Daisy.
Daisy has a cake.
You can't eat cake, Daisy.
Daisy has a magician.
You can't eat cake and magic, Daisy.
Would you like some cake?
Daisy has some cake.
When Daisy's cake has been eaten, Daisy is very sad. It looks as if the cake has disappeared, until the magician arrives, and all of a sudden, the cake reappears! There's a surprise at the end!
This is a book for children who love cakes, dogs and cake-stealing magicians. I loved the message that the book conveys. You can be good, be kind and be nice, and that can be enough. It doesn't matter what others think.
Hippo likes talking and bouncing.
Elephant doesn't like talking or bouncing.

Next PostNext 2021-08-04 Eric Robert Morse’s newsletter (on Substack)
Deep Time News is not immortal and will probably not survive forever. Sooner or later it will shut down. The main question is when.
One possibility is that I will simply run out of energy and enthusiasm and stop sending it out. Another is that the site and services will become so old and unsupported that they will no longer work. There is a third possibility that, just as a computer at some point slows down and must be upgraded, that the current software I am using will no longer work. And there is a fourth possibility that, just as a tape drive or punched card reader becomes unavailable as technical knowledge of the device goes out of circulation and the hardware itself gets old and wears out, so Deep Time News will simply not be able to maintain itself any longer.
What I’m suggesting is that sooner or later, some of you will decide that you want to create your own Deep Time News, or rather, a Deep Time News spin-off, something that, in a different way, can continue to publish the same sort of material that Deep Time News publishes now, material that has not previously been published elsewhere.
As of today, I am offering my list of subscribers (here on Substack) the opportunity to volunteer to continue Deep Time News in some form. If you want to volunteer, just drop me a note and we’ll work something out. If you volunteer, your volunteering is entirely at your discretion, and can stop at any time. The only commitment is that I would like to eventually have at least one person volunteering to continue Deep Time News in some form. This is because I think Deep Time News can be a useful and important platform for education and communication, and because I enjoy working on it, but I realize I don’t have the energy to do it forever. And I like the idea that it won’t just disappear completely when I stop doing it.
What would be involved in volunteering? Primarily, just republishing the material that I send out as Deep Time News. I am aware that volunteers need time to do the various things necessary to do Deep Time News, so I would send out material to the volunteer as soon as I send it out, but no sooner. In other words, a commitment to take material I have sent out, copy it, paste it, format it and, depending on how it is received, respond to it. This could take as little as an hour or two a week, depending on how you get your work done.
What you get in return for volunteering to continue Deep Time News is a sense of having worked on a project that I started, that some of you continue. Also, you get to be part of it.
The only thing I ask for in return is that you honor your commitment to continue, at least for a while, to put out a Deep Time News newsletter. No money is involved, except insofar as I agree to pay you a small honorarium to compensate you for your time and work. I have no way of knowing in advance what your expenses are, or even if you have expenses, so I can’t commit to a particular amount. I am more than willing to discuss this with you and negotiate a payment you feel is appropriate. If you choose not to be compensated, that is fine too. You do this for the sake of your own professional development, or for your own sense of accomplishment, not for money.
A couple of notes about the name: Deep Time News is named after the famous anthropologist, Loren Eiseley. If I was to continue Deep Time News, I would want to retain the name. I am happy to explain why, but I do not want to force my beliefs on anyone. That would be wrong and immoral, in my view. What I’m saying here is that if you continue Deep Time News under a different name, I will honor that decision. I want to stress this, because I know that I have been accused of trying to force people to subscribe to my newsletter. But that is not the case. This decision is entirely up to you.
Finally, I hope that all of you will seriously

Julia stared at the shivering figure across the table from her, desperately trying to focus on his words. “And that’s when you gave the cops all the evidence you had?” she said. The boy, Dylan, nodded, shifting his weight back and forth nervously. “Um-hmm.” Julia adjusted her glasses. “And then?”
The boy paused. “And then, I-I went home. I ran out the front door of the bakery as fast as I could.”
Julia leaned back in her chair. “Did you tell anyone about this before talking to the police?” she asked.
“You,” Dylan replied, blushing. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to say that—”
“It’s okay,” Julia interrupted. “You didn’t.”
“Right. Um,” Dylan cleared his throat, “I didn’t tell anybody else. Like, no one. Not even my parents. I just— I just thought that would be enough. That’s why I didn’t tell the cops anything. I just wanted to get it over with. I didn’t think—”
Julia nodded. She could feel her mind beginning to wander. “So, you’ve been back to the bakery?” she asked. “Since this happened?”
“A few times,” Dylan said, glancing away from Julia’s gaze. “I didn’t know about the app at first. But, I started feeling guilty. And—I didn’t think it was a good idea for me to just give up. It could have been any other customer, too. There could be other people at the bakery right now who aren’t okay.”
“Yeah,” Julia said. She stood up and went to the fridge, taking out a can of Pepsi. She turned around, taking a sip. “So, what else do you know?” she asked.
“I don’t,” Dylan said. “I don’t know who it was. I don’t know why it was me.”
“Okay.” Julia walked back to her chair, setting down the can of soda. “So, do you want to work on this together? I mean, there’s a lot of different people who could be affected by this.”
“Really?” Dylan replied, fiddling with a napkin on the table.
“Yeah, I think so. I mean, it’s important. This is a good opportunity for you.”
“Okay.” Dylan gave a tentative smile. “Okay.”
Four months later, Julia sat with the police officer she had been assigned to as a junior partner.
“We haven’t been able to find anyone who can tell us anything. Even the only witness from the bakery is still giving us nothing. The girl who left with you the day of the attack wasn’t at the bakery when this app thing happened, either.”
Julia fiddled with a strand of her hair. “Yeah, I know. It’s been really hard,” she said. “I’ve spoken with everyone I

2024-09-25 03:24:48,475 - Generated text:  a single loop-de-loop.
To your surprise, the inventor proceeds to construct an entire loop-de-loop roller coaster!
The inventor continues to construct, building the first upward incline and the first drop.
So the inventor screws the wheels to the back of the cart and then proceeds to run along the roller coaster, bringing the cart to a complete stop.
As the sun rises over the hillside, the inventor strikes up his silver whistle.
The first ride of the day is reserved for the inventor himself!
The inventor descends into the cart, and then all goes dark.
An eternity passes, and then the cart begins to ascend.
During the ride, the inventor discovers the coaster needs a little fine-tuning.
At the top of the ride, he inspects the coaster.
To your surprise, the inventor designs an additional hill, three more drops, and a loop-de-loop!
While working on his roller coaster, the inventor has come to loathe the lessons in engineering, mathematics, and physics, which he was forced to take in his youth.
Upon completing the new loop-de-loop, the inventor launches the cart!
Having completed the coaster, the inventor decides it is time to retire.
The inventor does not plan to build any more roller coasters, and is in fact planning on retiring for good.
As he eats his dinner of steak, peas, and potatoes, the inventor regrets that he did not spend more time with his family.
Just then, a fork flies out of the kitchen, through the window, and into the inventor's skull.
In a panic, the inventor staggers toward the kitchen.
Upon reaching the threshold, the inventor meets his end.
The inventor's bones, skull, and life are towed away by a fleet of junk trucks.
As his old bones were being carried away, the inventor realized his biggest regret: he could have saved a life had he turned his creation over to the junk trucks on time!
As he was carried away, the inventor's bones thought of a question: what happens to a roller coaster after the junk trucks take away the cart?
So the bones decided to contact their brother, the beam.
The brother, a beam of light, returns the message: do not worry. All of my wonderful inventions have been destroyed, but the roads have never been paved so well!
The bones are then carried to a junkyard.
In the junkyard, a car rests upon the coaster's coaster cart.
The inventor's bones and skull find themselves inside the car, and at last the inventor is reunited with his family.
The inventor is now carried away in his own vehicle.
And just like that, the inventor had a second chance to redeem himself.
And that, my friends, is a story about the inventor who lived on roller coasters.
How he went from thriving as a creator, to living his life as a creator's child.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,475 - Generated text:  own. As we drove toward it, me and Faye and Valerie, the ghost stories I'd told about it had lost their allure. Not that we were superstitious—Valerie just sat in the back, humming and trying to wring a song out of her sax—but for the first time in months I'd been deemed acceptable by Faye.
Because of the misery—or maybe the success, I wasn't sure which. I wasn't sure about anything.
But it felt good to have Faye looking at me. To have a friend, after so long.
The wind whipped around the small car as we turned in behind the theater. Faye insisted we park on the other side, where there was a wide expanse of grass between the ghost town and the highway. On the grassy shoulder, there were scraps of beer cans and pizza crusts and diapers that were too small to have any diaper in them. I tried not to look at them.
"Careful," Valerie said. "Don't trip."
She didn't look at me as she said it, but I knew she'd meant it. I could feel her eyes on me. The eyes of the goddess, the lost child, and her god. It was a warmth that lingered long after she looked away. I felt her think things about me, all of them good, and I smiled.
"Not funny," Faye said. I stopped, but Valerie, a little ahead of us, still wandered off.
Faye pulled her hood up, which made her face scrunch up, even more so, and she adjusted it a little. "Valerie's got a thing for ghosts."
"They can't hurt me," Faye said. She'd never seen me bring a ghost back to life. I'd never seen her burn one to death.
"Come on." I didn't know what to say, and I didn't want her to ask more questions.
She stepped toward me. Faye wore a long gray sweatshirt and black jeans, which were all right by me. I liked it when she dressed down. I liked it when she didn't look so perfect.
I reached into the pocket of my coat, fumbled for a cigarette, found one, lit it. She took a few steps away from me. "I thought you quit."
"I thought you didn't smoke."
She shrugged. "I don't."
"So why—"
"Why should I care?" she asked, her head bowed a little. She lifted her face up again, so that her hair, black and wet and wild, fell around it. It was a beautiful thing, I thought. I'd always been drawn to that kind of girl. Dark and sultry and sharp. I'd always felt like I fit best in the shadows.
"Not a nice habit," I said, and it was true. I'd only started because of her.
"It's not like I'm addicted."
"Still not a nice habit."
She pulled the hood back, squinted, looked up at the sky. "Fuck, it's cold."
"Told you it was going to get chilly." I tossed the cigarette to the ground. It flared out and then was gone. "You want to wait?"
"No." She tossed the hood back over her head. "Let's go."
The theater was dark inside, except for the glow of the light from the stage. Someone had left the lights on and a poster from some sort of Christian propaganda film. It had been here a long time, not an obvious recent addition, and I thought of my grandfather and his connection to this place. I wondered if he'd ever been here before.
"We should try the door," I said. I gave Faye a little shove and she stepped forward, reaching for the door, but I pushed her back. I had to admit I was nervous about what I might find if we opened the door. I knew it was silly. This place had been open for years. We should just open the door and go inside.
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know."
I reached for the handle and turned it, slowly, and the door swung open with a whimper. I waited until Faye was a few steps behind me before stepping inside. I was thinking about getting my ass kicked. I didn't know why I'd been so hesitant to get her into the theater

2024-09-25 03:24:48,476 - Generated text:  past mistakes and unexpected gains in this lyrical and touching novel about finding what truly matters in life.
Nineteen-year-old Emory Lovington was born into a family whose wealth was rooted in the cotton industry of the post-Civil War era. When Emory’s parents die suddenly in a fire that leaves her orphaned, she must find her own path.
The emptiness of losing everything is immense for Emory, especially when faced with the pervasive attitudes of her extended family and society: Women should not be given the right to vote, and the cotton plantations need to bring back the old ways in order to prosper. With an unforgiving society calling for the castration of “ladies with a proclivity to non-traditional notions,” Emory does everything in her power to seek acceptance, to hide her flaws. After all, one wrong step could mean her freedom.
In 1883, when cotton prices soar and the call for working hands returns, Emory gets the job she’s always wanted. Soon, she takes over the position of manager for the very plantation that brought down her family. But running the plantation is not what Emory expects, and in the end, she’s forced to make a choice between what’s expected and what’s right, a choice that will affect not just her life but the lives of everyone she loves.
Narrated by an omniscient, third-person point of view, Steel Magnolias examines the stories we tell about ourselves and others, with a nod to the choices we have to make when faced with the impossible.

I’ve been watching Japanese movies for a long time but haven’t seen one like this in a while. Especially from a sci-fi movie. The story and visuals of the film are very unique. The last time I saw something like this was Aliens Vs Predator. I mean both of these films’ endings are great, especially Predator. But I think the first 3/4ths are better. The first 3/4ths is more of a sci-fi movie, the last 1/4 is like an alien movie.
I don’t want to spoil it but one of the best parts is when they actually find out what’s happening, what the comet is, what it’s doing. They find out and the one thing they can do about it. And the journey to figure it out is the best part of the movie. The two families, the characters themselves are great. The movie has such a great feeling to it.
It’s definitely something you should check out. You don’t need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this. I mean you do need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy the whole thing but I think most people would be able to enjoy this. I also liked how the director was trying to blend his sci-fi film into a Japanese culture film. That’s why I’m giving this 9/10.
Thanks to Mr. McKinney for introducing this film to me.
Bite marks Finding Nemo Predator
Killshot (2005) – Review
In the near future a device is found that can transfer human consciousness into a robot body, this device becomes the greatest threat to mankind since the robot uprising in the series. An elite team is assembled to stop this threat and the only human that can be found is a man named Kenan. Kenan must enter the memories of each robot and then implant his mind into them.
I love this movie. I think the plot is original, the characters are funny and really interesting, and the special effects are great. This movie is great for those that like sci-fi and action, and it’s also great for kids because of the action and fun characters.
The only thing I don’t like about this movie is the way the story unfolds. I think it could have been more complex and interesting, but it still works well. It’s still a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi and action movies.
The whole movie is great, but I especially like the fight scenes and the action scenes, they are really good. I think they are the best parts of the movie.
If you’ve been watching movies for a long time, you know how difficult it can be to find a new sci-fi movie that is original. You know how many times you’ve seen the same old alien invasion movie, or the same old killer robot movie. It’s time to be different. Bite marks is one of the best sci-fi movies I’ve seen in a long time, and I’m glad it was made.
The best sci-fi movie I’ve seen in a long time, I think.
After the disaster of his last movie, Chris Hemsworth has to go back to what he knows best: playing a superhero. But in this sequel to the 2002 classic, he’s forced to change his strategy completely, with a whole new plotline.
The film is based on the book The Dragon Has Come to Eat Your Favourite Food, by Brian K. Vaughn. The film follows the titular dragon, a beast that devours everything in its path. But as the beast grows, its appetite for destruction also grows, and it begins to hunt down the heroes of the first movie, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.
The film has a whole new plotline, with Chris Hemsworth’s character now the Dragon, and the rest of the cast is composed of various other characters. It’s not the best sequel, but it’s a very fun film to watch.
The dragon is a fun and funny character, and I would recommend the film to anyone who loves the original, or who loves a good action movie. It’s a fun film to watch, and the action scenes are really good. It’s a fun sequel to the original, and it’s not as

2024-09-25 03:24:48,476 - Generated text:  winning a baking contest: take two sugars and add a pinch of salt.
In 1913, when the refrigeration unit of a locomotive caught fire, forty railroad men and boys, their work threatened by the destruction of the vehicle, strove to find and brew a drink to cool their parched mouths.
In a nearby town, a man with a lemonade stand saw an opportunity.
To these laborers and their companions, he shouted, “How about a lemonade?” After inquiring if anyone drank lemonade, he replied, “Cold and sweet.”
With that, 1,000 railroad men and boys received the first glasses of lemonade ever served to them on a railroad.
In the years since, the sweet beverage, brewed at the same stand, has survived a merger and changed hands several times. In 1976, at the birth of The New York Times, the company bought the recipe and has remained a loyal customer.
It is still 50 years later, but what has endured is the history and importance of what became the Big John Lemonade. A replica of the original stand is kept at the Times, along with all the lemonade-making equipment.
In a fitting tribute to one of America’s earliest lemonade stands, this story was included in a list of the 1,000 places to go before you die.
Today, the recipe for the drink is kept in a safe. Not because it’s a company secret, but because it is almost the size of the ingredients.
To ensure the drink is brewed exactly as intended, it takes only one ingredient to find the recipe: the lemonade glass itself.
The recipe consists of two ingredients: one cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice and one cup of sugar. After mixing, add a pinch of salt to each cup of lemonade.
A fifth ingredient is in the recipe itself: it is a secret, kept only by the staff of the Times.
The recipe is a closely guarded secret, and while the main ingredient is easy to find, the final ingredient, which is kept safe in a safe, is only revealed to those who want it most.
In the recipe book for Coca-Cola, the Coke secret is stored in a safe.
“What’s in the can is almost as important as what’s in the glass,” wrote the inventor John Pemberton in the early 1880s. “That’s why it’s so hard to keep the recipe a secret.
But in the case of the Big John, it’s a different story.
With only a few ingredients, the lemonade’s recipe is one of the most famous in the world.
In 1977, the Times began a new tradition by brewing 50 glasses of lemonade for the newsroom every week. In 1984, they bought the recipe.
Now, when the Times needs lemonade for an event, they have to find someone who’s willing to take a recipe, and it has to be a former Times employee.
“It’s a very simple process,” said Michael A. Conrad, the Times’ director of operations, who was the first to take on the job in 1998.
“You just go out and get some lemon juice. You just put it in a container. You get a lemon, and you just put it in the blender.
It’s like it’s really easy.” The recipe is kept in a small room at the Times, along with some of the ingredients, including lemon juice, sugar, salt, and the lemonade cup.
A fourth ingredient is hidden behind the scenes.
The lemonade, when served at the newsroom’s events, comes in a glass with a wooden handle, which keeps it safe in the safe while it’s brewing.
After brewing, the ingredients are added to the cup, where they are poured into the glass and mixed together.
While it’s brewing, the glass is washed with a rag, which is used to wipe away any leftover lemonade or lemonade residue.
The cup is then wrapped in a napkin and put in a bag.
Once the lemonade has cooled, it’s placed in a separate safe.
After the lemonade is made, the glass is taken back to the safe, where it’s

The work is meant to be seen and found while studying in a library. The format is designed in the way that the viewer can actually see, with the help of a magnifying glass, an unrevealed letter between pages. It’s written by young Sara, the female painter in the painting of the film. Her feelings for her muse, male poet Rachele is illustrated by the image of her painting (in Sara’s studio in the film) and the message. The format is designed for discovery and contemplation; therefore the readers’ activity becomes an integral part of the piece.

Reviews:Iain Thomas on Shelf Awareness for Readers wrote:
"This action-packed thriller is full of surprises, red herrings and twists."
C.D. Copelin on Reedsy Discovery wrote:
"Jack Donnelly has captured the essence of adventure fiction here, allowing us to experience the thrill of discovery in a completely unexpected setting. I loved the undersea subterranean locale and the realistic portrayal of scientific discoveries. The brisk, unpretentious dialogue reminds me of the ‘Doc Savage’ pulps from the 1930s and 1940s. If you enjoyed Donnelly’s ‘Jonas and Eden’, you will likely enjoy ‘The Reef’."
Mick Herron on his GoodReads page wrote:
"This is like one of those sixties adventures I used to read as a boy. The map, the black-sand beach, the sunken ship, the vast vessel hovering over them like a Sasquatch in a barn. The treasure hunt and the voyage into the unknown. I loved it."

2024-09-25 03:24:48,476 - Generated text:  gruesome murders. And the murderer has left a strange calling card. What does it say? An expert is needed. She is also a young woman with amnesia. Cynthia Varga will have to find a new memory and clear her name. There is a deadly chase for a killer before the woman will discover her past.
Psychologists Kendra Michaels and Jessie Damon must find out who murdered Dr. Rebecca Stapleton. It was a crime so foul that even shocking details cannot be revealed. Kendra knows that finding answers will require finding a new "nose" in a bloody crime scene. But she may be the only one who can track down the killer.
In "Evening in Death" Lieutenant Eve Dallas has a new name for the latest murder victim. The woman is nameless and faceless - only the victim of an anonymous sexual assault. But Eve and her lover, Roarke, both know that the face will come back to haunt them.
"Lamb to the Slaughter" by Ross Macdonald (HarperCollins, 239 pages, $14.95). One of the most talented mystery writers of the past century, Ross Macdonald wrote 21 novels. This was his last. And it is a dandy. The young hero is Adam Jameson, one of the most unlikely detectives you'll ever meet. Jameson is a San Diego divorce attorney who wants no part of being a private eye. But, as the lawyers say, "A gentleman doesn't refuse a favor to a lady." The lady is Dorothy Bream, the mother of a spoiled, rich brat who wants to pay his lawyer to find the truth about his son. He disappeared one night and then was found dead the next day. Apparently he was killed by a burglar, but there are suspicions it might have been his mother.
Macdonald brings his unique skills to the mystery. His hero, a ladies' man who is brutally honest about his failures in love, is as unlike Sherlock Holmes as possible. Macdonald's detective is nearly as quirky as the widowed Sharon McCone, who lives in the pages of Sara Paretsky's novels. He is a man of integrity who has to deal with his own mental hang-ups as well as a maniac's. And the maniac is a killer whose methods are anything but standard. He is a surgeon, but not a man who kills for money. He kills out of pleasure.
Jameson is quickly drawn into the problem of his client's son and is soon following a trail that leads him to a distant island. He is searching for a murderer who has a very personal connection to him. Macdonald's last novel is a polished gem that wraps up his extraordinary career. He's an author who died too young, but his mysteries will live for generations.
"Black Irish" by Frank Delaney (Bantam, 400 pages, $23). The author of "Shannon" and the novel on which the "Victor Victoria" movie was based brings to the mystery genre the same delightful storytelling that won him so much acclaim for his epic fiction. The Irish-American police detective working the murder case in this book, is much more complex than the typical lone wolf who wanders the mean streets in search of justice. Michael Boyle is a professional detective who wants to investigate murders, but not all of them. He prefers to look for the bad guys in cases involving ordinary people who are victims of everyday crimes. His loyalties are conflicted as the story begins because he has a relationship with a woman whose father is connected with the mafia.
"Black Irish" begins as Boyle is working on the investigation of a young waitress who is found shot to death. Although the evidence suggests that she was a drug addict whose death may be a gangland hit, Boyle is compelled to investigate it because he knows the victim. Boyle is faced with another conflict when his boss orders him to turn the case over to a uniformed police officer, a callow boy who "wants to be in the story of the century."
"Dog Sitting" by Lilian Jackson Braun (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 255 pages, $19.95). It's a strange world in which story characters jump off the printed page and begin to follow the lives of their makers. Or is it a strange world in which real authors, such as Lilian Jackson Braun, become connected with

2024-09-25 03:24:48,476 - Generated text:  the annual chore of pruning deciduous trees, roses and many shrubs. These blooms, however, are just one aspect of trees. The structure of the trunk is also something to admire.
Trees are huge living organisms. They grow through photosynthesis, which is a process that uses the energy of the sun to manufacture sugars and release oxygen as a waste product. This process of photosynthesis uses the nutrients in the soil to produce large, central trunks with relatively few side branches.
The largest tree species in the United States is the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). Redwoods may reach a height of 360 feet, with some specimens estimated to be more than 2,000 years old. Redwoods grow only in coastal areas of Northern California.
A large, spreading redwood tree gives us the distinctive look of trees along Pacific coast beaches. The airy, lacy foliage of the coast redwood tree is one of the tree species favored by wind lovers. The wind sweeps underneath the broad spreading leaves, leaving a sense of freshness.
Deciduous trees in our landscape may be massive, such as the 62-foot tall river birch (Betula nigra) on the southeast corner of the parish house. The birch grows so wide that its roots are in danger of uprooting the stonework. So its growth is restricted by cutting back each year some of its topmost branches, leaving four of the original trunks, or crotches.
In April, the birch tree is covered with yellow catkins. These are a mass of tiny, insignificant flowers that become birdseed. The catkins are produced by trees during alternate years, making a change in their appearance. The tree on the parish house is not a traditional birch tree, and is really more of a dogwood in size and leaf appearance.
Another deciduous tree often used as a landscaping specimen is the American elm (Ulmus americana). On our front lawn is a specimen with a trunk more than 2 feet in diameter. Because it produces male and female flowers in separate trees, the elm is wind pollinated and does not require insects to fertilize the flowers.
Elm wood has a hollow center, making it suitable for making baskets, barrels and the classic peacock tail fans. Unfortunately, elm trees are prone to damage by Dutch elm disease. The problem can be controlled by removing the diseased trunk and placing it on the compost pile.
One tree species, however, will not damage the compost pile. The bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) is native to Mississippi. These slow growing trees can live for hundreds of years and reach a height of 120 feet.
Cypresses are found on the coast, but they have become popular trees for residential landscaping. Some cities sell seedlings of bald cypress to homeowners. This species is easily transplanted. Because cypresses are long-lived trees, it is a good investment in an urban setting, with a lifetime of appreciation.
Bald cypress trees have so many uses. Their growth is so slow that they are rarely damaged by storms. Their leaves can be used to make brooms. Their wood, being so dense, is suitable for constructing boats, piers, and doors and windows. The bald cypress is also a vase, creating an interior atmosphere of spice and balsam scent.
An interesting form of this tree is found in a stand of bald cypress on the lawn atop the hill above the parish house. In the cool air above the ground, the tree becomes very thin and tall, making a noble specimen.
The flowers of the bald cypress are insignificant. The glory of the bald cypress is the foliage that unfurls in the spring to give its subtle beauty. The beautiful orange tones in this decorative accent plant will remain until the leaves drop in late autumn.
Another species of bald cypress is the swamp cypress (Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium). This tree species grows in the swamps of Mississippi. It has a root system that digs deep in the soft earth. But the structure of the swamp cypress is different from the bald cypress. The leaves have more rounded serrations. The bark on this species is a flaky light gray color.
Another interesting tree species is the dogwood (Cornus florida). This tree grows naturally along the coast and near springs. Some people like to plant dog

In her debut short film, "Happily Ever After," written by Kristen Vogt, Carolyn Atwell's direction and performance are both polished and delightful. We’re introduced to Susan (Atwell) after a devastating relationship breakup, which is the motivation for her telling her soon-to-be-ex-husband (Michael Sloan) about her new lover (Mike Farrell). It’s a surprisingly well-handled narrative about someone who is, more or less, too wrapped up in herself to care about her partner or her son. Not an easy subject to tackle, but Atwell handles it with her signature charm and effervescence.
Atwell, an actor, director, and producer, has assembled a very skilled team on this project. The costumes by Pamela Harwood and the hair and makeup by Bill Parker are spot-on for the 1960s. Jere Burns and Heather MacRae bring some nice support to the project, as do the cinematography by David Z. Levin, production design by Lyndsey Wackerman, and art direction by Andy Kornmiller. It's always nice to see a short film from a team with multiple talents.
"Happily Ever After" is a well-made movie with excellent performances from its cast, including the incomparable Michael Sloan and an eminently appealing lead performance from Carolyn Atwell. This is a strong start for Atwell's directorial career, and I look forward to seeing what she has to offer in the future.
-- Cedric, Rated Fiction Film Reviews
Seeing is believing and in these seven insightful stories, Carolyn Atwell proves to be a director with a truly vibrant vision of the world around her. Happily Ever After is a wonderfully delightful and oftentimes funny collection of short films showcasing a storyteller at her finest. While each short film has its own individual story, Atwell skillfully ties them all together through the theme of relationships. Carolyn Atwell manages to tackle the subject matter of relationships with such compassion and insight that she succeeds in creating a truly touching collection of short films that are a pleasure to watch.

A Collection of Short Films on Relationships
What makes "Happily Ever After" a remarkable cinematic gem is how it explores the essence of all human relationships. The seven stories in this short film are held together by common elements of romance, love, break-ups, infidelity and reconciliation. Each of the seven stories stands alone with its own unique flavor and style. Every actor is genuinely credible, authentic and spot-on with their characters. Carolyn Atwell creates an intense, intimate and heart-felt quality in the way she portrays each of the characters in their full spectrum of emotions. It is a thoroughly engaging collection of film shorts with the ever-present theme of relationships.

Happily Ever After is a 2016 collection of seven short films by producer, writer, actor and director Carolyn Atwell. It will be released on DVD in early 2018.
The collection opens with a surreal, black-and-white fantasy that is completely different from the other stories. It’s the story of an old man who reflects on the time he lost in a crowd, and then finds he’s lost his son as well.
“First Steps,” one of the highlights of the collection, takes place in the early 1960s and involves a young boy who worships his parents. In one memorable scene, his mother teaches him the difference between “look,” “listen” and “wait,” each of which is done in its own way.
The tale of a man whose parking space has been usurped by a fire hydrant and whose apartment has been burgled is funny and cynical.

Among many valuable resources, rainforests also hold a secret: they hide treasures from thousands of species of biodiversity. Even the more well-known scientific community thinks that more than 90% of the world’s species still live in them. But how many more can still be discovered? In July 2018, an expediion brought more than 600 researchers to the north of Brazil, who found new and rare species of Amazon flora and fauna. The Amazon Rainforest Research Expedition (ARRE) was the largest expedition in history, with many international participants. The expedition led by Conservation International, however, did not seek monetary reward. The purpose was to make the public aware of the importance of protecting the biodiversity of the Amazon.
In a statement, Conservation International said that during the expedition, more than 150 new plant species were found, from which 83% were considered extremely rare. The expedition also identified 760 new species of ants and beetles and about 100 new species of fish, as well as 68 species of frogs, reptiles, bats and rodents. One of the most interesting discoveries is the Eleutherodactylus polonussong, a new species of frog that only inhabits a very small area in northwestern Amazonia, and very few in number. This discovery shows that researchers can continue to find new species for a very long time.
According to Conservation International, scientists estimate that there are still 4 million to 7.5 million species still to be discovered. Until now, only 1.2 million species have been described, including 1 million insects. Only 14% of the Amazon’s river basin has been studied, and many are afraid that in the search for natural resources, these ecosystems are being degraded and even destroyed. According to the Conservation International report, 17% of the Amazon Rainforest has already been degraded.
The same way, the local governments and their indigenous population may only recognize a few species. It is also in the local populations that there is greater knowledge of the species, the medicinal and food uses, and the connection of the species with their origin and its identity. The indigenous populations share a greater affinity with the Amazon than with any other habitat. They know that by nature, the inhabitants of the Amazon and their rivers are in perfect harmony, which helps to maintain the biodiversity and ecosystem.
In the Amazon region, there are about 650 different ethnic groups, and according to a study by the University of Oxford, the Indians have about 1500 languages, of which only a small number are recognized by Brazilian institutions. The displacement of native populations and their forced expulsion has increased in recent years, with its consequences on their indigenous knowledge, which is the genetic heritage of a group of people. It was only in 1988, in the Constitution of Brazil, that the concept of the collective rights of the indigenous population was recognized, and only in 2018 that the court made it possible for all indigenous lands to be delimited and their borders to be clearly defined.
Researcher Luiz Bruno Fernando Ferreira (ICMBio/USP)
After the discovery, it was pointed out that the current and planned deforestation in the Amazon can reduce the number of species in 10 years. Fernando Ferreira, biologist at the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso in Cuiabá and member of the Amazon conservation team, says that we have much more to discover and that the place that we have yet to research is unimaginable. According to Ferreira, many of the newly found species are the result of the Amazon’s biodiversity diversity. The next major expedition should focus on some highly protected areas in Brazil.
In August 2019, there will be another expedition with 135 scientists, who will cover 100 kilometers on the Ampére River in the Brazilian Amazon. The new expedition will last 6 weeks, and the purpose will be to identify and catalog new species, as well as other useful discoveries such as the use of plants as medicines or the extraction of materials used in local cultures, food and drinks. The scientists plan to carry out 11 more expeditions to the region in the coming years.
Conservation International reports that Brazilian Amazonian tribes have been using plant and animal extracts for centuries to heal diseases, from fever to headache and for rheumatism. This knowledge of ind

This is the latest story written by John Green in a video blog, "VlogBrothers"
Brother Hank has it out with John for taking the time to write and produce a story, when Hank (allegedly) has no time to do so.
This may be an inventive or clever presentation, but no cleverness is in the story. You might think that someone has taken one of those stories "Your Day is Now Beginning," and made a VlogBrothers video out of it, but you would be wrong.
What is more clever is that the video itself is divided into nine sections, each dedicated to a "sister" (not "aunt") of the fictional ladies from Greek mythology, thus honoring the mythos, or sisterhood, that sisterhood supposedly means.
The story is written by Hank and John; both are credited for the story, and by coincidence, Hank is playing Chiron. Of course John wrote the story for his brother. The actors are put in costumes in the color of the character for each of the sections of the story.
Each character is interviewed (by John) about the weather and its power over their lives. John, in his ever cynical, uncaring attitude, completely denies the meaning of the rainbow that appears during the last "sister," as well as dismissing the meaning of the symbolism of the fish and the serpent as well. (John apparently didn't get the Phd from his brother that Hank got, because that surely would have put him right, and made him become the good brother instead of the bad one.) The story is supposed to take place in Northeastern Ohio, but if it does, then nobody should try to get too close to their houses. They should move south to Arizona, because of the weather.
Finally, this video shows the hypocrisy of modern life, like the way we see marriage as the ultimate goal of romance, when it is nothing but an ugly bureaucratic exercise.
No further comment is necessary; it is simply a poor representation of two brothers. It is a throwaway script, more or less of the caliber of the daytime soap operas. How John Green can write such a garbage script makes one wonder if there's something wrong with the brain of the guy. No wonder he's "depressed," but hopefully, he will recover his mental health and look for a new line of work.

Here's another picture of some kitties I took.
It took us a while, but we finally realized that, contrary to our expectations, the cat we have named "Creamsicle" is a he.
This is indeed a good thing, because cats who spray urine are normally male. Females also spray urine, but they don't spray all over the house. They go to the bathroom outdoors, as they are supposed to.
The cat "Creamsicle" was neutered today. I couldn't find the vet where we took him. I took a picture of the sign.
Not a "real" kitty, but a Halloween cat that was apparently spray-painted.
Took pictures of the Halloween store I took the boy to, but the pictures turned out blurred. It was not really Halloween weather outside, and it is really hard to take good pictures in such conditions.
Nevertheless, the pictures do show that the local Spirit Halloween store is stocking up for Halloween, the only thing that the store carries year-round, even though it is the only Halloween-oriented store in town. We got to look at the new Halloween candy, too, which the boy enjoyed.
No pictures this time. There are no great places here where I can take pictures of interesting sights. The local Drugstore.com is closed. The hot dog stand is gone. The old Subway sandwich shop (the best one in the whole country) is gone. There's nothing left to take pictures of, and I have almost no money to take the boy anywhere anyway.
Not that the boy would want to go anywhere. Today he had to go to the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles), but at least we could walk over to CVS to have something to eat. They give you free cookies if you're there before the store opens. Unfortunately, the boy missed it, because he came right at the opening time, which meant that he got only a half dozen.

During their months of preparation they have demonstrated a commitment to excellence and a dedication to working together to develop their God given talents. These attributes do not always show up on their report cards or on the scale of a sports activity but these are the very qualities that make them attractive to the world around them.
Dress rehearsal is a wonderful time because you get to see what works and what needs a little more work. We can’t wait to show the world what we have been working on and the sense of accomplishment is wonderful! There will be no more hard work or worries about little things like what to wear or what to say. It is time to put all that to rest and to focus on what really matters.
Thank you to our parents and teachers who gave of their time and energy to help guide these young children. It is only by your investment that our children become a reflection of our society that is filled with positive people, peace, and love. Thanks also to the audience for coming out and showing your support. Together we are stronger!
The moments we can be immersed in the joy of creation and seeing things come together for a common goal are priceless. I remember one day in the second grade our entire class sat down at the front of the class to play the recorder. We practiced that song for several weeks and played it for the parents at our Christmas program. The audience couldn’t believe that we would all just start to play a song that we had not practiced or rehearsed. The children were a reflection of their parents and a beautiful sight to behold! It takes a lot of love and hard work to accomplish such a goal but with the gift of God it can be done.
By sharing my thoughts and observations about things that happen in school, I hope to give parents a small glimpse into what their children are learning during the day. I want to focus on their joys and struggles so that parents can be aware of how their child is growing and maturing. Although the focus of this post is about the Christmas program I think we can all agree that children are the future of this world and we should nurture them to be the best that they can be.

One thought on “That Special Time of the Year”
I love what you said about Christmas being a time to celebrate God’s love and care for all! That’s why I love Advent so much–it’s a time of preparation and prayer in a spirit of joy, anticipation, and service–the very essence of Christian life!
I love the idea of “creative living” that you shared in one of the previous posts. In a way, I believe that’s what Christmas is all about: participating in the life of Christ in the various ways we experience his birth, life, death, and resurrection each year. But Advent gives us the time and space to reflect on these gifts and, indeed, to take them deeper and even more seriously. Thanks for sharing, Joan! You’ve given me a lot to think about in my Advent meditations! May your Advent be blessed!

2024-09-25 03:24:48,477 - Generated text:  housing and food accessibility
A sustainable and self-sufficient housing concept by Salla Thanula. (Courtesy of Salla Thanula)
What if there was a project that could provide solutions to a country's basic needs, while also creating sustainable economic growth, empowering the poor, and building social cohesion?
This is the main idea behind Finland's Affordable Family Homes Project, an initiative by NGO MedCaring, which offers families in need and refugees the opportunity to earn money by taking care of one another and growing vegetables for themselves and their communities.
The Housing model
Starting with a pilot project, the idea of the Affordable Family Homes Project originates from the desire of two refugees and one Finn to make a positive change in their communities.
"The idea was created from three Finnish and two Somali refugees, and the key idea behind the whole concept is that the project is designed by the people it is for," project manager and social worker Hanna Maula told Africa Report.
Each family is assigned an average-sized flat in a multi-family building in an urban area, in which they receive a below-market rent. These buildings are modular, designed for quick and affordable construction. They are energy-efficient, each is equipped with solar panels and built using recycled materials. Each flat has two rooms and a kitchen area, as well as a bedroom or study for each person.

Besides the housing, families receive a solar-powered garden kit and seed packs to grow their own vegetables, as well as animal feed for a beehive. The gardens are divided into a communal part and each family's private area, to maintain the space for all participants to share and make it less challenging for the families to take care of.
"Their responsibility is to grow their own vegetables for the family and to give away any excess to their neighbor," Maula said. "It's a kind of barter system where families exchange their vegetables and other things."
The project aims to reduce economic inequality by offering an affordable solution for poor families, as well as providing sustainable ways to create social cohesion. (Courtesy of Affordable Family Homes Project)
Since the housing units were designed with the urban setting in mind, they can easily be added to existing infrastructure, which increases the affordability.
"One goal is to provide shelter for those who do not have their own, and the second one is that it is affordable housing that doesn't cause social exclusion or homelessness in the long run," Maula said.
While the project has so far included families of Somali refugees, this can also be an opportunity for those with housing needs in the local community, according to Maula. They also include the possibility of accommodating families who are not refugees but who are poor or in need. The project can be replicated to create affordable and sustainable housing for the local community as well.
"Social isolation is a big problem in Finland, so this project aims to reduce the gap between people living in different areas of Finland," Maula said.
Meeting societal needs
Besides the housing aspect, another goal is to facilitate work-life balance and provide employment opportunities. To achieve this, a community center is created in each building, where the families work as community caregivers. The community caregivers provide service to the elderly and people with disabilities. The caregivers are paid a fair living wage, which allows them to pay for their children's education and save for the future.

"We also see this model as a way to improve housing conditions for elderly and disabled people who might not otherwise be able to live in an apartment, because it might be too expensive, and there is a need for home care for them," Maula said.
This project offers a model for participatory planning and enables the creation of intergenerational cohesion in urban areas.
With the population growing, more and more people will soon be moving to cities.
"One of the most important goals in the project is that urban areas become more livable," Maula said.
In order to achieve that, the project aims to provide not only affordable housing, but also to create opportunities for residents to grow their own food in urban environments,

The poet, listening to the waves on the beach, or the wind in the trees, or the rustling of leaves, captures the quiet, the stillness.
Isn’t it like the quiet times in your heart that you want to capture, too?
What is it that you hear in the heart of God, that you want to capture in poetry or song or painting or photos or films? What is the quiet in your heart?
The sound of a child’s laughter or the stillness of a songbird, the song of an orchestra or the breeze through the trees, the cries of the wind or the roar of the ocean—it is all music to your soul, is it not?
As you listen to God’s heart beating with yours, what inspires you to create?
Who do you capture in poetry or painting or in photos or film? Who or what do you capture with your imagination? Who or what do you capture with your words?
Who is it that you love? Who is it that you want to create for? Who is it that you listen to? Who is it that you wish to capture? Who is it that your words, your photos, your paintings, your film, or your music is for?
Ever since God spoke His first word, “Let there be light” and there was, He has been the Word, inspiring man to create for Him.
What does God say is His favourite art form? Painting, poetry, music, dance, film, or photography?
Is there any art that you can think of that doesn’t express a love for God? Even the choice of film, the choice of music, or the choice of subject matter in your photos, your paintings, or your film can express your heart for or against God.
When your art is creating something beautiful for God, when you create something that lifts up His Name, when your art is inspired by Him, when you paint or take photos or dance for Him, or create a piece of film that shares His story, when you love the characters you create with all the same heart and hope that God has for them, what are you creating?
What are you capturing in your art? How are you capturing your heart?
“Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands” (Psalm 100:1, KJV).
If you could capture your heart in any art, what would it be? Would you rather paint than write, play piano instead of guitar, dance instead of paint, or make a film instead of photographing?
God has created you to create. He has created you to create something beautiful for Him. He has created you to create art that lifts up His Name.
Do you feel God’s whisper in your heart, “You are my beloved”? He is saying to you, “Create something beautiful for Me.”
Do you feel God’s whispers in your heart, “You are My beloved”?
In your art, do you feel God whispering to you to create something beautiful for Him? Do you feel God’s prompting to create with a love for Him?
Is it inspiring your art?

2024-09-25 03:24:48,477 - Prompt 124: A book club for superheroes becomes contentious when they can't agree on
2024-09-25 03:24:48,477 - Generated text:  whether the story's primary character is a strong-willed gal or a weak-willed jerk.
It's not really the strong-willed gal part of the book that my group can't agree on, it's the other thing.
The problem is my opinion is... In my opinion... Well, let me back up a minute here...
And this is where we come to a part of our story where a lot of people feel there should be a little bit of context. So, basically, before we get into this story, let me put it to you this way: For most of us, "Strong-willed gal" and "Weak-willed jerk" are terms of binary opposition. But sometimes, the meaning of these terms is neither binary nor opposed.
So here's a bit more context: In this story, it doesn't really make any sense to say that "X" is "strong-willed" and "Y" is "weak-willed." You can't talk about "X" being more "strong-willed" than "Y" without using the terms in some different sense of their definitions. Either you're using the terms to mean "Not the other thing," or you're using them to mean something else entirely.
See, in this story, the thing that makes the character "strong-willed" is what makes him also a "weak-willed jerk." You can't even understand the reason why someone would call him a "weak-willed jerk" without first coming to terms with what "strong-willed" means. The thing that makes the character strong-willed makes him also a weak-willed jerk.
It's an uncomfortable, paradoxical truth. You can be strong-willed and weak-willed at the same time, and the thing that makes you strong-willed also makes you weak-willed, and vice versa. That is, to say that the character "X" is strong-willed means nothing if we don't take "weak-willed" in its new, paradoxical sense as well.
My problem with the book is that it was ambiguous about what it meant when it said "strong-willed" and what it meant when it said "weak-willed," and for some of us it was important to resolve that ambiguity, and for some of us it was important to maintain it.
I think it's about an analyst's private practice who is good at talking about people who are weak-willed and in need of his services, but when the time comes for him to go in there and help them, it is not clear at all how "strong-willed" is in any way advantageous.
Do you not find that problematic at all?
Oh, he's definitely... That character, that analyst, is definitely not helpful, not strong-willed, at all. That character is bad news.
And do you think you can all agree on that?
I mean, you're pretty weak-willed... Not exactly the same thing, but...
Weak-willed? Well, yeah, I guess you can say that. But he's helping, too.
How can you say that? He's definitely not helping. You see him do absolutely nothing!
Nothing? What are you talking about? He's always offering little bits of advice and support and positivity!
Really? He didn't offer any advice to those people?
He did? I thought he just told them they're weak-willed!
No, he really is very supportive!
Really? Because I never saw any support from him.
You want to talk about his support? I want to talk about his support. In chapter five he talks about support. Do you see it? In this passage, he's explaining how support is part of how to be strong-willed, and in this passage he's describing support as "offering whatever support you can to people that need your support."
What did you do when you needed support?
I called you and you didn't answer!
And yet you are reading this passage about how support is part of how to be strong-willed.
But what I said was, "I have to work this weekend."
I called you and you didn't answer! I said, "I have to work this weekend," and you still didn't answer.
But still, you went on with that passage about offering support to people.
So this passage about offering support to people, it's not about the analyst, right?
No, it's about other people! It's not about him!

2024-09-25 03:24:48,478 - Generated text:  travelers can ski. But there are many obstacles to overcome: environmental disasters, alien viruses, and the shadowy organization Interworld itself. In the sequel to The Seven Keys to Baldur, Charles Sheffield returns with a fantasy-science fiction novel that combines vivid action and powerful ideas, the kind of storyline that many readers already associate with Sheffield's name.
Jeffrey Burke, one of the main characters in this novel, is quite unique among the many tourists who visit planets. A tinkerer, he quickly figures out the flaw in the skiing machine, a problem of insufficient friction, and demonstrates to the management how easy it would be to devise a solution. Instead, Interworld decides to blame him for the accident and sends him to a jail-like space prison in order to hide the company's real culpability. He enlists the aid of his former love Julia Amory, an environmental activist who fought in a previous conflict with Interworld, and there are others who would like to help Burke because of their distaste for the company's role in environmental degradation.
Their escape is soon aided by the interplanetary covert group the Korsairs and their weapon-flying bat-like aircraft. Their leader is Roque Sullivan, whose role in saving Jeffrey Burke in a previous novel has earned him respect and trust. The story continues as Sullivan and his team help Burke find other Korsairs, who turn out to be some of the most notorious criminals ever known in the galaxy, who fight against Interworld for various reasons.
A more familiar type of adventure story is portrayed by Daniel Duncan, another character, whose high-tech spaceship suffers a series of breakdowns that he must troubleshoot. His task is to repair the vehicle, as well as get some rare minerals, in order to make enough money to travel in style on another planet. Since this book takes place in a time where human space travel has been an adventure for 300 years, the culture and scenery on the different planets is remarkably exotic.
One of the mysteries of The Visitors is the Earth-like situation where alcoholism and addiction to illegal drugs run rampant, in addition to rampant over-population. The visitors themselves are revealed as aliens in the end, and they claim that many of the problems on the various planets are of their making, including the control that Interworld has over these worlds. They also explain that this situation is nothing new. In fact, many of the planets they control were all collapsed under Interworld's guise in the past.
This book is a kind of glimpse at what might happen in the future, when humanity becomes more advanced and travels more freely among the stars. As we meet many interesting characters, the future seems very bright in this situation, but the storyline brings us up against the many issues of galactic travel.

These experiences provide the individual with opportunities to experience learning events through an educational approach that permits simulation and interaction with the environment to create meaningful learning experiences. Enhanced interactivity of these environments make them a powerful source for learning, and an alternate reality learning experience provides a different way of learning compared to traditional learning methods.
The virtual reality is defined as a "computer-generated simulation of a real-world environment, physical objects or real-world events"[1].
Virtual reality in education consists of creating and modeling complex three-dimensional, three-dimensional environments in order to deliver interactive learning experiences[2]. These environments provide users with an unprecedented sense of presence, in which the individual experiences sensory stimuli within the environment in which he or she exists.
Educational technology uses a variety of digital media to simulate the development of real and fictitious environments to advance learning and learning performance.

Historical background of the virtual reality
Virtual reality technologies began to be researched in the mid-1950s. During the 1950s and 1960s, ideas about virtual reality began to appear. First it is necessary to know the main players who have contributed to its development, starting with J. C. R. Licklider[3], who was interested in developing a 3D interface and computational information systems. In 1960 he proposed the term 'virtual reality' to describe the 3D computer-generated graphics that he was interested in creating[4] In 1962, Licklider was appointed head of the Computer and Communications Services Division at the Information Processing Techniques Office in the United States (US) Air Force in the US Department of Defense (DoD). He immediately started a series of projects, known as the Intergalactic Computer Network (ICN), which had as its main objective the development of communication networks between different organizations around the world, including human-machine interaction research.
Later in 1968, Ivan Sutherland[5], "the father of VR", developed the first VR machine, the Sword, in 1962[6]. In 1965 he founded the first VR research laboratory in the world, the first in the United States[7] and called his first VR Machine Sketchpad[8]. This first sketching environment had the ability to make geometries, with the use of two-dimensional pen tools. The representation of 3D models in 2D was no longer adequate, so in 1968, the U.S. Army Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) commissioned a team of programmers to develop an alternative solution to 3D graphics with an interactive graphical interface[9]. Sutherland returned to Harvard University with the goal of developing computer-controlled devices for drawing in 3D. In 1968 he developed his first virtual reality program, head and face (2D) system.
In the same year, Ivan Sutherland's VR research project was transferred to the new MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. During his studies, Sutherland proposed the concepts of Virtual Reality and Virtual Reality. Ivan Sutherland was looking for ways to improve the ease of drawing on paper and bring some mathematical theory to this area.
A year later, in 1969, Sutherland coined the term 'virtual reality' to describe a form of 3D computer graphics with interactivity.
The purpose of this interaction was to see the design from different angles and thus improve the modeling process. Sutherland and other researchers explored the concept of a device that can display three-dimensional images in real time.
In 1969 he founded the first VR lab in the world at the University of Utah. He called it the Utah Digital Graphics Facility, and together with Bob Sproull he created its first VR program. Virtuality is a three-dimensional representation of objects, enabling human users to feel realistic virtual experiences. Virtual reality consists of simulating the five senses: vision, smell, hearing, taste and touch[10]. This has to do with a technological base that seeks to create sensory immersion, to create or simulate a situation that would not be possible

Title: How to Betray a Dragon’s Hero
*a standalone read
“It’s not a secret you’re skilled at this,” Hiccup said. “I’ve seen you battle off Gronckle tribes twice your size.”
“You want to bet, Red?” said Viggo.
“I’ve never let a bet with Viggo decide a battle.”
A book set on Vikings! How to Betray a Dragon’s Hero is a young adult novel about the How to Train Your Dragon series, only instead of the teenager fighting with the hero, it’s told from the villain’s perspective. In other words, this book is from Viggo Grimborn’s point of view, who is pretty much a foil to Hiccup Haddock. There are a few differences, but we still see the basic traits that we would see in a Hiccup book: Hiccup is stubborn, and Viggo is clever. He’s more confident, and Hiccup is more creative. They’re still both funny and adorable, but there is something a little more confident about Viggo than Hiccup. So far, there are only a few parallels.
So, the book starts off in the perspective of Viggo, then it switches to Hiccup, then it goes back and forth between the two. Viggo is disillusioned about being a bloodthirsty Viking, while Hiccup is very straightforward about being a Viking. That’s the basic premise, and it’s pretty funny. However, it is a little slow. The first quarter of the book was very boring, until the plot began moving again.
“Those books are easy,” Hiccup said.
“The first level is easy?”
“They’re the hardest ones.”
“You like a challenge, don’t you?” Viggo said, stabbing a date into a plate.
“Maybe,” Hiccup said. “I’ve always liked being right.”
The ending is a little cheesy and anti-climatic. It’s very upbeat, but I wouldn’t have expected the ending to be this straightforward. However, the rest of the book is enjoyable, so it’s worth reading for the humour and character development. If you enjoyed the previous books in the series, you should also read this book.
Thumbs up! I’d recommend this book.
Overall, this book is funny and I enjoyed the characters. I liked the extra perspective on the story. The ending was very cliché.
How to Betray a Dragon’s Hero is an awesome book! I love both Hiccup and Viggo, and I am so excited that they’re different from each other. In my opinion, this is a wonderful book.
I had the same problem, with reading the book for the humor and characters and feeling like the ending fell flat. I also agree that if you liked the other books, this is a book to read. And that ending was so, SO cliché, but somehow I still liked it.
Cynthia @ BOOKS 'N' CYN
I loved this book too. I was sad that the ending didn't seem to satisfy me, but it was nice to hear Viggo's perspective on the same story. Nice review, you really made me miss my dog!
Ah, I'm so behind on reading this series! lol I've read 1-4 and I need to get to the rest! Thanks for the heads up, I'll be sure to have my expectations lowered! 😉

2024-09-25 03:24:48,478 - Generated text:  the unity and progress of human civilization
Traditional pottery is made from local clay and has a unique style. In the early period, man worked hard to refine nature and created pottery, which was easy to operate, cost-effective and had great utility value.
Shanxi pottery, as one of the six major ancient pottery styles in China, is a famous and special product of Shanxi province, which is popular in the northern plain area in ancient times. In the Tang Dynasty, the state government offered the same rewards as Buddhist statues for obtaining relics and Buddhist paintings. The prices for pottery are as high as paintings, stone carvings and Buddhist statues.
Since ancient times, Shanxi ceramics have a high reputation both at home and abroad. In the Ming Dynasty, the Shanxi Pottery, which was admired by the Qing court, was sent to the royal palace in large quantities. The Vatican had bought many pottery products from Shanxi pottery kilns in the Ming Dynasty and enjoyed a high reputation in Europe.
Gaobei pottery has a history of nearly 4000 years. In the Neolithic Age, the Shanxi pottery was refined by the ancients, and they have made great efforts to produce some pottery pieces that are easy to use and look good, and the craftsmanship of these pottery products is outstanding.
Both the interior and exterior of Gaobei pottery are painted with fine colors, which are clear and bright, full of rich details and powerful handwriting. The surface is soft and round.
The painting of pottery is a skillful creation of the masterpiece. The artistic painting techniques of Gaobei pottery were refined and inherited from ancient times.
In order to enhance the resistance to erosion of the pottery and improve its decorative effect, the kiln painted pottery mainly uses four ways of glaze: onion glaze, apple glaze, stone glaze and color glaze.
The unique design and craftsmanship make Gaobei pottery have a rich variety, attractive appearance and natural colors, all of which perfectly reflect the wisdom and creativity of pottery in ancient times.
Today, people still deeply respect and appreciate the aesthetic value of ancient pottery culture, and give full play to the inherent value of Shanxi pottery, and continue to spread the connotation of cultural heritage to the world.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,478 - Prompt 133: The chef's secret recipe for the perfect dish
2024-09-25 03:24:48,478 - Generated text: .
A truly good chef will make a recipe of his own for every dish he prepares. However, to be able to determine that you have prepared the dish well, it is important to know the ratio of all the ingredients you put in it. Even if it's the same ingredients as those used by other chefs, each dish will be different. The ingredients will be cooked differently and the taste will be different. For the most accurate way to measure the ingredients in cooking, a digital scale is recommended. Most importantly, don't forget to wash your hands after you're done cooking. That's what makes a chef!
The relationship between taste and sight!
However, if you don't know the recipe of the dish you are making, you are sure to mess up your dish.
A cook is not a person who can put in the right amount of the ingredients in every dish they make. Some ingredients will work better than others in different dishes. So, you have to be a little more careful when you are cooking. It is also very important to know the chemical reactions that occur in food when it is cooked. This will help you know the proper amount of ingredients to put in the dish. If you know the proper amount of the ingredients you need to put in the dish, you can easily use a scale.
Digital scales are used in most homes today.
Digital scales are usually used for measuring the weight of ingredients and can also be used to measure the weight of food. These scales are also very useful when you are baking and need to know the amount of flour, sugar, baking powder, and other ingredients. A digital scale can also be used to measure the weight of food like meat, fish, and other foods.
For example, when you are making bread, you will need to know the weight of flour, sugar, yeast, and other ingredients. With a digital scale, you can measure these ingredients and also measure the weight of the dough. It is also very easy to measure the weight of the dough in this way.
Shrubs, also known as fermented drinks, are drinks that are naturally fermented and have a slightly sour taste. They are usually made from fruits and vegetables, but can also be made from milk or honey. They are often consumed as part of a meal and are used to prepare sauces, desserts, and other dishes.
A shrub is a drink made from fermented fruit, usually wine. It's a sweetened mixture of fruit juice and vinegar. You can use it as a condiment or as a cocktail ingredient. Some people also use it as a pickle or to marinate meat. The name comes from the French word “soupe” meaning "soup."

There are many different ways to measure ingredients in the kitchen. You can measure them using a scale, or you can use a measuring cup. However, the most accurate way to measure ingredients is with a digital scale.
A digital scale is an electronic device that is used to measure the weight of objects. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including cooking, baking, and gardening.

2024-09-25 03:24:48,479 - Prompt 135: A magical flea market where every item has a story, including a teapot that
2024-09-25 03:24:48,479 - Generated text:  seems to have gone missing. The business of the decade: a flying school where students learn to swim in the sky. A magical street and a market square that constantly recreate themselves. A museum whose collection of paintings, sculptures, textiles and crafts is the only one of its kind in the world.
And everything is accessible from a tall glass tower. This is Kuntz Street.
Kuntz Street, perhaps its most famous property, is a square in Dulwich, South London. It was developed in the 1980s by Sir Nicholas Grimshaw and launched in 1985 as a residential development. It is regarded as a work of art, designed as a public space to demonstrate the benefits of architecture. It was the winner of the RIBA and The Sunday Times Civic Trust awards and shortlisted for the RIBA Building of the Year award.
Despite being built on 1980s urban planning, the apartment is often likened to an enchanted street from a fairy tale. The Civic Trust’s Civic Voice, which was also founded in 1974, aims to protect Kuntz Street as a heritage site and plans to oppose the residential development.
Kuntz Street itself is built on the existing site of the former Buckingham Road station, abandoned by London Transport in the 1960s. The 15,000 sq ft site comprised an L shaped building, which served as a bus station and an industrial building, and was divided into a multitude of buildings, shops and car parking facilities. The terrace of the new development has a range of tall buildings on the left, single family homes on the right and a public space between them. The terrace is partially covered by a glass skylight, while its outside wall is the steel structure of a bridge.
The building includes two halls, one on each floor of the building, located in the former industrial block. The halls are used for a variety of purposes, such as a church, a dance studio, a private cinema and a swimming pool. The largest of the two halls, with the dimensions of 55 m x 12 m, was converted into a chapel. In the right corner, near the altar, there is a step with benches, resembling the pews found in the synagogue, and the other steps are for worship.
Furthermore, the architectural style of the glass tower is rather like the houses of Henry VIII in Hampton Court. The outer walls are finished with a textured concrete finish and the steel structure is finished with sandstone blocks. The play of shadows that moves around the building is mainly due to the light filtering through the steel and glass structure.
In addition, the glass tower also acts as a lighting system for the rest of the apartments and the garden, which has its own concrete pavilion. To protect the owner from the noise of passing traffic, the building was equipped with a quiet pavilion, but it is not fully integrated with the tower.
Sir Nicholas was inspired by the old warehouses of St. Katherine’s Dock, particularly the warehouse by Reginald Blomfield. Kuntz Street is located on a busy street near the waterfront, where it is easily accessible.
However, many of these buildings are no longer in use and the light industrial units in the area are not fit for purpose. Kuntz Street and its neighbouring streets are described as “quiet, and generally safe to explore”. The developer said the plans to build new homes on the site would preserve its unique character, and its owners are committed to preserving the site’s “quiet, safe, friendly environment”.
There is not a significant conflict of interest here, as its developers and owners are responsible for protecting the listed building and its environment from neglect. I feel that the history of the building is as important to its value as the architectural and historical significance of the site. I want to know if the new owner would be able to maintain the site’s character and heritage, and if he would be willing to spend money on repairs and improvements.
As a conservation architect, I believe that the new development should not only preserve its history and heritage, but also protect its value by restoring it to its original form. However, I am not against the building of new homes on the site. In fact, I feel that a large portion of its owners and its owners’ building should be available for free to the public.
In addition, Kuntz Street is also a very interesting residential project, and although it has been described as a “confusing and confusing mess of buildings,”

Few female figures had the impact of Mary Pickford. The actress was named co-founder of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and created a film studio for her name. She was the biggest star in Hollywood during the silent film era, but when she died in 1979, none of her biographies said anything about her sexuality. The actress was always private about her personal life.
Her lost interview surfaced, revealing insights into her life.

“It’s a funny thing, the people you admire. As you get older, they become human,” the interviewer begins as the film opens. She is interviewing the actress in 1973, three years before her death, and when the footage was found, it was still missing around 25 minutes of the film. The interview had ended the day Pickford turned 64, but afterward she brought her old friend Lillian Gish, Pickford’s childhood friend and former co-star, to join in a jovial conversation about their lives in the film industry. The two talked about their own careers and also recalled times that they had been pulled over by the police. Pickford and Gish also reminisced about their childhood together, having met each other when they were six years old. Both Pickford and Gish began their careers as stage actors, which resulted in being part of the famous repertory companies and moving to film.
The interview isn’t about Pickford’s career. She reveals little of her life in the film industry, but the conversation allows audiences a glimpse of the type of person Pickford was in private. “Do you feel about Hollywood as you felt when you were there?” the interviewer asks Pickford. “It’s always been very pleasant, never unpleasant,” she says. Pickford comments that audiences have changed since the early years of film, “they don’t like young people, they like grown-ups.”
As the two talk more and more about their personal lives, Pickford’s private nature begins to show. “No, I don’t believe that, I believe in love and home,” she says when the interviewer asks her if love and home were important to her. When the interviewer asks what kind of love Pickford is referring to, Pickford changes the subject. She mentions that Gish is still traveling across the world and that Pickford “just took a trip to Moscow and I was all over the world.”
Pickford does not seem interested in sharing her private life with the public. She doesn’t discuss the relationships in her life or what kind of marriage she might be looking for. She remarks that she hasn’t been married and doesn’t mention when she had a relationship with an actor named Charlie Chaplin.
After the interview, Gish and Pickford move onto other topics. They talk about Chaplin and how he would play pranks with the actors. “We had quite a time together, and he would sit in a chair and [pretend] a cigar was a horse,” Gish says. Pickford finishes their discussion by saying, “That man’s a genius, it’s not fair.”
As the interview with Pickford continues, the private and reserved actress becomes a little more open. When Gish asks about her friend being her inspiration in her early career, Pickford’s eyes brighten up and she speaks lovingly about Gish. “Lil’s the most wonderful friend. That’s why I’ve stayed with her for so long, and all our friendships,” Pickford says. “We love each other.”
The revelations in the interview didn’t stop there. Another video surfaced, this time showing Pickford in a documentary on the rise of silent films. The documentary aired after Pickford’s death and showcases both her film and private lives. One clip of the documentary shows a moment between Pickford and a reporter in 1929. As she answers questions, she seems unsure of the question but happily gives her answer. When she reve
